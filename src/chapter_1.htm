<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Abhidhammattha-Sangaha</b> is the name of the book. Abhidhamma, 
literally, means &quot;Higher Doctrine&quot;. <em>Attha</em> here means &quot;things&quot;. <em>
Sangaha</em> means &quot;a compendium&quot;. </p>

<p>The prefix &quot;<em>abhi</em>&quot; is used in the sense of preponderant, great, 
excellent, sublime, distinct, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Dhamma</b> is a multi-significant term, derived from the root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>dhar,</i> to hold, to support. Here the Pāli term is used in the 
sense of doctrine or teaching. According to the Atthasālini, &quot;<i>abhi</i>&quot; 
signifies either &quot;<i>atireka</i>&quot; -higher, greater, exceeding - or &quot;<i>visittha</i>&quot; 
- distinguished, distinct, special, sublime. </p>

<p>Abhidhamma means the Higher Doctrine because it enables one to achieve one&#39;s 
Deliverance, or because it exceeds the teachings of the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya 
Pitaka. </p>

<p>In the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka the Buddha has used conventional terms 
such as man, animal, being, and so on. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka, on the 
contrary, everything is microscopically analyzed and abstract terms are used. As 
a distinction is made with regard to the method of treatment, it is called 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>Thus, chiefly owing to the preponderance of the teachings, or because it is 
conducive to one&#39;s Deliverance, and owing to the excellent analytical method of 
treatment, it is called Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. The <b>Abhidhamma Pitaka</b> consists of seven treatises - namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>i. <b>Dhammasangani</b> - &quot;Classification of Dhammas&quot;. </h3>

<p>This book is divided into four chapters, viz:- </p>

<dl>
  <dd>
  <p>(1) - (Citta) Consciousness, </dd>
  <dd>
  <p>(2) - (Rūpa) Matter, </dd>
  <dd>
  <p>(3) - (Nikkhepa) Summary, </dd>
  <dd>
  <p>(4) - (Atthuddhāra) Elucidation. </dd>
</dl>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 22 <b>Tika Mātikās</b> (Triplets) and the 100 <b>Duka-Mātikās</b>
(Couplets), which comprise the quintessence of the Abhidhamma, are explained in 
this book. The major part of the book is devoted to the explanation of the first 
triplet - <em>kusalā dhammā, akusalā dhammā</em> and <em>abyākatā dhammā</em>. 
In extent the book exceeds thirteen Bhānavāras* (recitals), i.e., more than 
104,000 letters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>* Bhānavāra = 250 verses: 1 verse = 4 lines: 1 line = 8 letters. One 
	Bhānavāra, therefore, consists of 8000 letters</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>ii. <b>Vibhanga</b> - &quot;Divisions&quot;.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are eighteen divisions in this book. </p>

<p>The first three divisions, which deal with </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p><i>khandha</i> (aggregates) </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>āyatana</i> (sense-spheres) and </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhātu</i> (elements), </li>
</ul>

<p>are the most important. </p>

<p>The other chapters deal with </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p><i>sacca</i> (truths,) </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>indriya</i> (controlling faculties), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>paccayākāra</i> (causal genesis), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>satipatthāna</i> (foundations of mindfulness), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>samma-ppadhāna</i> (supreme efforts), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>iddhi-pāda</i> (means of accomplishments), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>bojjhanga</i> (factors of wisdom), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>jhāna</i> (ecstasies or absorption), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>appamaññā</i> (illimitable), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>magga</i> (paths), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>sikkhā-pada</i> (precepts), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>patisambhidā</i> (analytical knowledge), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>ñāna</i> (wisdom), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>khuddaka-vatthu</i> (minor subjects), and </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhamma-hadaya</i> (essence of truth). </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of these divisions consist of three parts - Suttanta explanation, 
Abhidhamma explanation, and a Catechism (Pañhapucchaka). </p>

<p>In this treatise there are thirty-five Bhānavāras (280,000 letters).</p>

<hr>

<h3>iii. <b>Dhātukathā</b> - &quot;Discussion with reference to Elements&quot;. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This book discusses whether Dhammas are included or not included in, 
associated with, or dissociated from: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>aggregates <i>(khandha),</i> </li>
  <li>
  <p>bases <i>(āyatana),</i> and </li>
  <li>
  <p>elements <i>(dhātu). </i></li>
</ul>

<p>There are fourteen chapters in this work. In extent it exceeds six Bhānavāras 
(48,000 letters). </p>

<hr>

<h3>iv. <b>Puggalapaññatti</b> - &quot;Designation of Individuals&quot;.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the method of exposition this book resembles the Anguttara Nikāya of the 
Sutta Pitaka. Instead of dealing with various Dhammas, it deals with various 
types of individuals. There are ten chapters in this book. The first chapter 
deals with single individuals, the second with pairs, the third with groups of 
three, etc. In extent it exceeds five Bhānavāras (40,000 letters). </p>

<hr>

<h3>v. <b>Kathāvatthu</b> - &quot;Points of Controversy&quot;</h3>

<p>The authorship of this treatise is ascribed to Venerable Moggalliputta Tissa 
Thera, who flourished in the time of King Dhammāsoka. It was he who presided at 
the third Conference held at Pātalaliputta (Patna) in the 3rd century B.C. This 
work of his was included in the Abhidhamma Pitaka at that Conference. </p>

<p>The Atthasālini Commentary states that it contains one thousand Suttas: five 
hundred orthodox and five hundred heterodox. In extent it is about the size of 
the Dīgha Nikāya. </p>

<p>This book deals with 216 controversies and is divided into 23 chapters.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>vi. <b>Yamaka</b> - &quot;The Book of Pairs&quot;. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is so called owing to its method of treatment. Throughout the book a 
question and its converse are found grouped together. For instance, the first 
pair of the first chapter of the book, which deals with roots, runs as follows: 
Are all wholesome Dhammas wholesome roots? And are all wholesome roots wholesome 
Dhammas? </p>

<p>This book is divided into ten chapters - namely, </p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p><i>mūla</i> (roots), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>khandha</i> (aggregates), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>āyatana</i> (bases), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhātu</i> (elements), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>sacca</i> (truths), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>sankhāra</i> (conditioned things), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>anusaya</i> (latent dispositions), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>citta</i> (consciousness), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhamma,</i> and </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>indriya</i> (controlling faculties). </li>
</ol>

<p>In extent it contains 120 Bhānavāras (960,000 letters). </p>

<hr>

<h3>vii. <b>Patthāna</b> - &quot;The Book of Causal Relations&quot;. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the most important and the most voluminous book of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. One who patiently reads this treatise cannot but admire the profound 
wisdom and penetrative insight of the Buddha. There is no doubt of the fact that 
to produce such an elaborate and earned treatise one must certainly be an 
intellectual genius. </p>

<p>The term Patthāna is composed of the prefix &quot;pa&quot;, various and &quot;thāna&quot;, 
relation or condition <i>(paccaya).</i> It is so called because it deals with 
the 24 modes of causal relations (explained in a subsequent chapter) and the 
triplets <i>(tika)</i> and couplets <i>(duka)</i> already mentioned in the 
Dhammasangani, and which comprise the essence of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. </p>

<p>The importance attached to this treatise, also known as &quot;Mahā Pakarana&quot;, the 
Great Book, could be gauged by the words of the Atthasālini which states: &quot;And 
while He contemplated the contents of the Dhammasangani His body did not emit 
rays, and similarly with the contemplation of the next five books. But, when 
coming to the Great Book, He began to contemplate the 24 universal causal 
relations of condition of presentation, and so on, His omniscience certainly 
found its opportunity therein.* </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Realities</b> - There are two realities - apparent and ultimate. 
Apparent reality is ordinary conventional truth <i>(sammuti-sacca).</i> Ultimate 
reality is abstract truth <i>(paramattha-sacca). </i></p>

<p>For instance, the smooth surface of the table we see is apparent reality. In 
an ultimate sense the apparent surface consists of forces and qualities or in 
other words, vibrations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For ordinary purposes a scientist would use the term water, but in the 
laboratory he would say H2O. In the same way the Buddha in the Sutta Pitaka 
resorts to conventional usage such as man, woman, being, self, etc., but in the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka He adopts a different mode of expression. Here He employs the 
analytical method and uses abstract terms such as aggregates <i>(khandha),</i> 
elements <i>(dhātu),</i> bases <i>(āyatana),</i>
etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The word <i>paramattha</i> is of great significance in Abhidhamma. It is a 
compound formed of <i>parama</i> and <i>attha.</i> <i>Parama</i> is explained as 
immutable <i>(aviparīta), </i>abstract (<i>nibbattita);</i> <i>attha</i> means 
thing. <i>Paramattha,</i>
therefore, means immutable or abstract thing. Abstract reality may be suggested 
as the closest equivalent. Although the term immutable is used here it should 
not be understood that all <i>paramattha</i> are eternal or permanent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A brass vessel, for example, is not <i>paramattha.</i> It changes every 
moment and may be transmuted into a vase. Both these objects could be analyzed 
and reduced into fundamental material forces and qualities, which, in 
Abhidhamma, are termed <i>rūpa paramattha.</i> They are also subject to change, 
yet the distinctive characteristics of these <i>rūpas</i> are identically the 
same whether they are found in a vessel or a vase. They preserve their identity 
in whatever combination they are found - hence the commentarial interpretation 
of <i>parama</i> as immutable or real. <i>Attha</i> exactly corresponds to the 
English multi-significant term &quot;thing&quot;. It is not used in the sense of &quot;meaning&quot; 
here. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are four such <i>paramattha</i> or abstract realities. These four 
embrace everything that is mundane or supra mundane. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The so-called being is mundane. Nibbāna is supra mundane. The former is 
composed of <i>nāma</i> and <i>rūpa.</i> According to Abhidhamma <i>rūpa</i>
connotes both fundamental units of matter and material changes as well. As such 
Abhidhamma enumerates 28 species of matter. These will be dealt with in a 
subsequent chapter. <i>Nāma,</i>
denotes both consciousness and mental states. The second chapter of this book 
deals with such mental states <i>(cetasikas)</i> which are 52 in number. One of 
these is <i>vedanā</i>
(feeling). Another is <i>saññā</i> (perception). The remaining 50 are 
collectively called <i>sankhāra</i> (mental states). The receptacle of these 
mental properties is <i>viññāna</i>
(consciousness), which is the subject-matter of this present chapter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the above analysis the so-called being is composed of five 
Groups or Aggregates <i>(pañcakkhandha):</i>- <i>rūpa</i> (matter), <i>vedanā</i>
(feeling), <i>saññā</i> (perception), s<i>ankhāra</i> (mental states) and <i>
viññāna</i>
(consciousness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consciousness, mental states (with the exception of 8 types of supra mundane 
consciousness and their adjuncts), and matter are Mundane<i> (lokiya),</i> and 
Nibbāna is Supra mundane <i>(lokuttara).</i> The Supra mundane Nibbāna is the 
only absolutely reality, which is the summum bonum of Buddhism. The other three 
are called realities in that they are things that exist <i>(vijjamāna dhammā).</i> 
Besides, they are irreducible, immutable, and abstract things. They deal with 
what is within us and around us. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first <i>paramattha</i> or reality is <i>citta.</i> It is derived from 
the root <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>citi,</i> to think. According to the 
commentary <i>citta</i> is that which is aware of <i>(cinteti = vijānāti)</i> an 
object. It is not that which thinks of an object as the term implies. From an 
Abhidhamma standpoint <i>citta</i> may better be defined as the awareness of an 
object, since there is no agent like a soul. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Citta, ceta, cittuppāda, nāma, mana, viññāna</b> are all used as 
synonymous terms in Abhidhamma. Hence from the Abhidhamma standpoint no 
distinction is made between mind and consciousness. When the so-called being is 
divided into its two constituent parts, <i>nāma</i> (mind) is used. When it is 
divided into five aggregates<i>
(pañcakkhandha), viññāna</i> is used. The term <i>citta</i> is invariably 
employed while referring to different classes of consciousness. In isolated 
cases, in the ordinary sense of mind, both terms <i>citta</i> and <i>mana</i> 
are frequently used. </p>

<p>The other three <i>paramatthas</i> will be dealt with in their due places. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>5. <b>Kāma</b> is either subjective sensual craving or sensuous objects such 
as forms, sound, odor, taste, and contact. By <i>kāma</i> is also meant the 
eleven different kinds of sentient existence-namely, the four states of misery <i>
(apāya),
</i>human realm <i>(manussaloka), </i>and, six celestial realms <i>(sagga). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Avacara</b> means that which moves about or that which frequents. <i>
Kāmāvacara,</i>
therefore, means that which mostly moves about in the sentient realm, or that 
which pertains to the senses and their corresponding objects. As a rule, these 
types of consciousness arise mostly in the aforesaid sentient existence. They 
are found in other spheres of life as well when objects of sense are perceived 
by the mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="page11"></a>6. <b>Rūpāvacara, Arūpāvacara</b> respectively mean 
either that which pertains to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa jhānas</i> (ecstasies) or 
that which mostly moves about in the <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> planes. </p>

<p><i>Rūpalokas</i> are planes where those who develop <i>rūpa jhānas</i>
are born. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A question now arises - &#39;Why are these distinguished as <i>rūpalokas</i>
when there are subtle material bodies <i>(rūpa)</i> in heavenly planes too?&#39; The 
commentarial explanation is that because beings are born in these planes by 
developing <i>jhānas</i>
based mainly on <i>rūpa</i> <i>kasinas,</i> - material objects of concentration 
such as earth, water, fire, etc. </p>

<p><i>Arūpalokas</i> are planes without material bodies. By the power of 
meditation, only the mind exists in these planes. </p>

<p>Ordinarily both mind and body are inseparable, but by will-power, under 
exceptional circumstances, they could be separated, just as it is possible to 
suspend a piece of iron in air by some magnetic force. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Loka + Uttara</b> = Lokuttara. Here <i>Loka,</i> means the five 
aggregates. <i>Uttara</i> means above, beyond or that which transcends. It is 
the supra-mundane consciousness that enables one to transcend this world of 
mind-body </p>

<p>The first three classes of consciousness are called <i>lokiya</i>
(mundane). </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>8. <b>Akusala, Kusala, Vipāka, Kiriya- </b></p>

<p>In the previous section consciousness was broadly classified under four 
divisions according to the planes in which it is experienced. With respect to 
its nature it divides itself into four classes. Some types of consciousness are 
immoral <i>(akusala),
</i>because they spring from attachment <i>(lobha),</i> aversion or ill-will <i>
(patigha),</i>
and ignorance <i>(moha).</i> Opposed to them are the moral types of 
consciousness<i>
(kusala), </i>because they are rooted in non-attachment or generosity <i>
(alobha),</i>
goodwill <i>(adosa), </i>and wisdom <i>(amoha).</i> The former are unwholesome 
as they produce undesirable effects <i>(anittha vipāka), </i>the latter are 
wholesome as they produce desirable effects <i>(ittha vipāka).</i> Both <i>
kusala</i> and <i>akusala cittas</i>
constitute what, in Pāli, are termed <i>kamma.</i> Those types of consciousness 
that arise as the inevitable results of these <i>kusala</i> and <i>akusala 
cittas</i> are called <i>vipāka</i> (resultant) <i>cittas.</i> It should be 
understood that both <i>kamma</i>
and <i>vipāka</i> are purely mental. The fourth type of consciousness is called <i>
kiriya</i>
which, for want of a better term, is rendered by &quot;karmically ineffective&quot;, 
&quot;inoperative&quot; or &quot;functional&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Three Roots (Mūla)-</b> </p>

<p><i>Lobha, dosa,</i> and <i>moha</i> are the three roots of evil. Their 
opposites are the roots of good. </p>

<p><i>Lobha,</i> from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lubh,</i> to cling, or 
attach itself, may be rendered by &#39;attachment&#39; or &#39;clinging&#39;. Some scholars 
prefer &#39;greed&#39;. Craving is also used as an equivalent of <i>lobha. </i></p>

<p>In the case of a desirable object of sense, there arises, as a rule, clinging 
or attachment. In the case of an undesirable object, ordinarily there is 
aversion. </p>

<p>In Pāli such aversion is termed <i>dosa</i> or <i>patigha. Dosa</i> is 
derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dus,</i> to be displeased. <i>
Patigha</i> is derived from <i>&#39;pati&#39;,</i> against, and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>
&#39;gha&#39; (han),</i>
to strike, to contact. Ill-will, hatred are also suggested as equivalents of <i>
&#39;patigha&#39;.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Moha</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muh,</i>
to delude. It is delusion, stupidity, bewilderment. It is <i>&#39;moha&#39;</i> that 
clouds an object and blinds the mind. Sometimes <i>&#39;moha&#39;</i> is rendered by 
ignorance. </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma, <i>moha</i> is common to all evil. <i>Lobha</i>
and <i>dosa</i> do not arise alone, but always in combination with <i>moha. 
Moha,</i> on the other hand, does arise singly-hence the designation <i>
&#39;momūha&#39;,</i> intense delusion. </p>

<p>Diametrically opposed to the above three roots are the roots of <i>kusala.</i>
They not only indicate the absence of certain evil conditions, but also signify 
the presence of certain positive good conditions. <i>Alobha</i> does not merely 
mean non-attachment, but also generosity. <i>Adosa</i> does not merely mean 
non-anger or non-hatred, but also goodwill, or benevolence, or loving-kindness <i>
(mettā). Amoha </i>does not merely mean non-delusion, but also wisdom or 
knowledge <i>(ñāna</i> or <i>paññā).
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Vedanā or Feeling-</b> </p>

<p><a NAME="MORCON5"></a>Feeling or, as some prefer to say, sensation, is a 
mental state common to all types of consciousness. Chiefly there are three kinds 
of feelings -namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>somanassa</i> (pleasurable), </li>
  <li> <i>domanassa</i> (displeasurable),
  </li>
  <li> <i>upekkhā</i> (indifferent, neutral, equanimity or neither pleasurable 
  nor dis-pleasurable). </li>
</ul>

<p>With </p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>dukkha</i> (physical pain) </li>
  <li> <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness) </li>
</ul>

<p>there are altogether five kinds of feelings. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Somanassa</i> is an abstract noun formed of <i>&#39;su&#39;,</i> good, and <i>
&#39;mana&#39;,</i>
mind. Literally, the term means good-mindedness, i.e., a pleasurable feeling.  </p>

<p>Similarly <i>&#39;domanassa&#39;</i>
<i>(&#39;du&#39;,</i> bad, and <i>&#39;mana&#39;,</i> mind) means bad-mindedness i.e., a 
dis-pleasurable feeling.  </p>

<p>The third feeling is neutral. Indifference is used here in this particular 
sense, but not in the sense of callousness. <i>Sukha</i> is composed of <i>&#39;su&#39;,</i> 
easy, and <i>&#39;kha&#39;</i>
to bear, or to endure. What is easily endured is <i>&#39;sukha&#39;</i> i.e., happiness. <i>
Dukkha (du,</i> difficult), pain, is that which is difficult to be endured. Both 
these sensations are physical.  </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma there is only one type of consciousness accompanied 
by pain, and one accompanied by happiness. Two are connected with a 
dis-pleasurable feeling. Of the 89 types of consciousness, in the remaining 85 
are found either a pleasurable feeling or a neutral feeling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Somanassa, domanassa,</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> are purely mental. <i>Sukha</i>
and <i>dukkha</i> are purely physical. This is the reason why there is no <i>
upekkhā</i>
in the case of touch which, according to Abhidhamma, must be either happy or 
painful. (See Upekkhā, 
<a href="#42-Upekkha">Note. 42</a>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Ditthi-</b> </p>

<p>This term is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>&#39;dis&#39;,</i>
to see, to perceive. It is usually translated as view, belief, opinion, etc. 
When qualified by <i>&#39;samma&#39;,</i> it means right view or right belief; when 
qualified by <i>&#39;micchā&#39;,</i>
it means wrong view or wrong belief. Here the term is used without any 
qualification in the sense of wrong view. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Sankhārika-</b> </p>

<p><a NAME="NOTE33"></a></p>

<p>This is purely a technical term used in a specific sense in the Abhidhamma. 
It is formed of <i>&#39;sam&#39;,</i> well and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>&#39;kar&#39;,</i>
to do, to prepare, to accomplish. Literally, it means accomplishing, preparing, 
arranging.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like <i>dhamma, sankhāra</i> also is a multi-significant term. Its precise 
meaning is to be understood according to the context. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When used as one of the five &#39;aggregates&#39; <i>(pañcakkhandha),</i> it refers 
to all the mental states, except <i>vedanā</i> and <i>saññā.</i> In the <i>
paticca-samuppāda</i>
it is applied to all moral and immoral activities, good and bad thoughts. When <i>
sankhāra</i>
is used to signify that which is subject to change, sorrow, etc., it is 
invariably applied to all conditioned things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this particular instance the term is used with <i>&#39;sa&#39; =</i> co-; and <i>a 
=</i> un, <i>Sa-sankhārika</i> (lit., with effort) is that which is prompted, 
instigated, or induced by oneself or by another. <i>&#39;Asankhārika&#39;</i> (lit., 
without effort) is that which is thus unaffected, but done spontaneously. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If, for instance, one does an act, induced by another, or after much 
deliberation or premeditation on one&#39;s part, then it is <i>sa-sankhārika.</i> 
If, on the contrary, one does it instantly without any external or internal 
inducement, or any premeditation, then it is <i>asankhārika.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Vicikicchā-</b> </p>

<p>This is an ethic-religious term. Commentary gives two interpretations. </p>

<p>(1.) <i>Vici = vicinanto,</i> seeking, inquiring; - <i>kicch,</i> to tire, to 
strain, to be vexed. It is vexation due to perplexed thinking. </p>

<p>(2.) <i>Vi,</i> devoid + <i>cikicchā,</i> remedy (of knowledge). It means 
that which is devoid of the remedy of knowledge. </p>

<p>Both these interpretations indicate a perplexed or undecided frame of mind. 
Doubt, perplexity, skepticism, indecision are used as the closest English 
equivalents. </p>

<p>Reasoning or investigation for the sake of understanding the truth is not 
discouraged in Buddhism. Nor is blind faith advocated in Buddhism. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2"><i>&nbsp;</p>

</i></font>

<p>[Vicihicchā is the inability to decide anything definitely that it is as 
such. Buddhaghosa-Majjhima Nikāya Commentary.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Uddhacca-</b> </p>

<p>This is formed of <i>u</i> = over, and - <i>dhu,</i> to tremble, to get 
excited. Literally, it means &#39;over-excitement&#39; or &#39;rousing up&#39;. A confused 
restless state of mind is meant here. It is the antithesis of one-pointedness. 
Atthasālini explains <i>uddhacca</i>
as disquietude, mental distraction or confusion. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Kusala and Akusala-</b> </p>

<p>This section deals with <i>akusala</i> types of consciousness. <i>Akusala</i>
is the direct opposite of <i>kusala.</i> Atthasālini gives the etymological 
meaning of <i>kusala</i>
as follows:- </p>

<p>(1.) <i>ku,</i> bad, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sal,</i> to shake, to 
tremble, to destroy. That which shakes off, destroys evil or contemptible things 
is <i>kusala.</i> </p>

<p>(2.) <i>kusa</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lu,</i> to cut. </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kusa</i> is from <i>ku,</i> bad, and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>si,</i>
to lie. That which lies contemptibly is <i>kusa,</i> vice. <i>Kusala</i> is that 
which cuts off vice. </p>

<p>(3.) a.) <i>ku,</i> evil, bad, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>su,</i>
to reduce. That which reduces or eradicates evil is <i>kusa,</i> knowledge or 
wisdom. <i>Kusa,</i>
so derived, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lu,</i> to cut. That which cuts 
off (evil) by wisdom is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>b.) <i>Kusa,</i> so derived, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>la,</i>
to take. That which is grasped by wisdom is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>(4.) Kusa grass cuts a part of the hand with both edges. Even so <i>kusala</i>
cuts off both sections of passions - those that have arisen and those that have 
not arisen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With regard to the connotation of the term the Atthasālini states:- </p>

<p>&quot;The word <i>kusala</i> means &#39;of good health&#39; <i>(ārogya),</i>
&#39;faultless&#39; <i>(anavajja),</i> &#39;clever&#39; <i>(cheka),</i> &#39;productive of happy 
results&#39; <i>(sukha-vipāka)&quot;.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the exception of &#39;clever&#39; all the other three meanings are applicable to <i>
kusala.</i> </p>

<p><i>Kusala</i> is wholesome in the sense of being free from physical and 
mental sickness through passions. </p>

<p><i>Kusala</i> is faultless in the sense of being free from the fault of 
passions, the evil of passions, and the heat of passions. </p>

<p>Here <i>sukha-vipāka</i> does not necessarily mean pleasurable feeling. It is 
used in the sense of physical and mental buoyancy, softness, fitness, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atthasālini further states <i>kusala</i> is used in the sense of having 
accomplished with wisdom <i>(kosallasambhūtatthena; kosallam vuccati paññā).</p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judging from the various meanings attached to the term, <i>kusala</i>
may be interpreted as wholesome or moral. Some scholars prefer &#39;skillful&#39;.</p>

<p><i>Akusala</i> would therefore mean unwholesome or immoral. </p>

<p><i>Kusala</i> and <i>akusala</i> correspond to good and bad, right and wrong 
respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. How are we to assess whether an action is <i>kusala</i> or <i>akusala?</i>
What is the criterion of morality?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short what is connected with the three roots of evil is <i>akusala.</i>
What is connected with the three roots of good is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>As a seed sown on fertile soil germinates and fructifies itself sooner or 
later, according to its own intrinsic nature, even so <i>kusala</i> and <i>
akusala</i>
actions produce their due desirable and undesirable effects. They are called <i>
vipāka.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Kiriya or Kriyā</b>, literally, means action. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here <i>Kiriya</i> is used in the sense of ineffective action. <i>Kamma</i>
is causally effective. <i>Kiriya</i> is causally ineffective. Good deeds of 
Buddhas and Arahats are called <i>kiriya</i> because <i>kamma</i> is not 
accumulated by them as they have gone beyond both good and evil. </p>

<p>In Abhidhamma <i>vipāka</i> and <i>kiriya</i> are collectively called <i>
avyākata</i>
(Indeterminate), that which does not manifest itself in the way of an effect. 
The former is <i>avyākata,</i> because it is an effect in itself, the latter, 
because it does not produce an effect. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES FOR THE TWELVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMMORAL 
CONSCIOUSNESS:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Attachment</b></p>

<p>(1.) With joy a boy instantly steals an apple, viewing no evil thereby.
</p>

<p>(2.) Prompted by a friend, a boy joyfully steals an apple, viewing no evil 
thereby. </p>

<p>(3.) (4.) The same illustration serves for the third and fourth types of 
consciousness with the difference that the stealing is done</p>

<p>without any false view. </p>

<p>(5.) (6.) (7.) (8.) The remaining four types of consciousness are similar to 
the above with the difference that the stealing is done with neutral feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Ill-will</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(9.) With hatred one murders another without any premeditation. </p>

<p>(10.) With hatred one murders another after premeditation. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>19. <b>Killing:-</b> According to Abhidhamma killing is invariably done with 
ill-will or aversion. Prompted by whatever motive, one, as a rule, kills with a 
thought of ill-will. Where there is ill-will <i>(patigha)</i> there is 
displeasure <i>(domanassa).</i>
Where there is displeasure there is ill-will in a subtle or gross way. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, a little child, who cannot discriminate between right 
and wrong, smilingly kills an ant. He does not know that he is committing the 
evil of killing. He is only playing with it. Now, does he cherish any ill-will 
towards the ant? Is there any hatred or ill-feeling in his case? It is difficult 
to say so. What type of consciousness does he experience at that moment? It 
cannot be the 9th and 10th types because he innocently does it with joy, 
fondling the object. Could it be the third type of consciousness rooted in <i>
&quot;lobha&quot;? </i></p>

<p>An adult who kills for sport does experience the 9th or 10th type of 
consciousness. There is ill-feeling at the moment of killing. </p>

<p>What about vivisection? A scientist may vivisect without the least 
compunction. His chief motive may be scientific investigation for consequent 
alleviation of suffering. Yet, there is the thought of killing. </p>

<p>Does one experience ill-will when one kills a wounded animal with the object 
of putting an end to its suffering? Moved by compassion, one may do so; yet 
there is ill-will at the moment of killing, because there is a certain kind of 
aversion towards the object. If such an action is morally justifiable, could one 
object to the wholesale destruction of patients suffering from acute chronic 
incurable diseases? </p>

<p>It was stated above that there is ill-will where there is displeasure. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When, for instance, one feels sorry for having failed in an examination, does 
one harbor ill-will at that time? If one reflects on the meaning of the term <i>
patigha,</i> the answer will become clear. There is no doubt a subtle kind of 
aversion over the unpleasant news. It is the same in the case of a person who 
weeps over the death of a dear one, because it is an unwelcome event. Anāgāmis 
and Arahats never feel sorry nor grieve, because they have eradicated <i>patigha</i> 
or <i>dosa</i> (hatred or ill-will). </p>

<p>Great was the lamentation of Venerable Ananda, who was a Sotāpanna Saint, on 
the passing away of the Buddha; but Arahats and Anāgāmis like Venerable Kassapa 
and Anuruddha, practiced perfect equanimity without shedding a tear. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Ignorance </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(11.) A person doubts the existence of the Buddha, or the efficacy of the 
Dhamma, owing to his stupidity. </p>

<p>(12.) A person is distracted in mind, unable to concentrate on an object. </p>

<p>As these two types of consciousness are feeble, due to stupidity or dullness 
of mind, the accompanied feeling is neither pleasurable nor displeasurable, but 
neutral. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. The ten kinds of <i>akusala</i> (evil) in relation to the twelve types of 
immoral consciousness. </p>

<p>There are ten kinds of evil committed through deed, word and thought. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>

    </font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>All these <i>akusalas</i> are committed by the afore-mentioned twelve types 
of <i>akusala</i> consciousness. Killing is generally done by the 9th and 10th 
types of consciousness. Stealing is generally done with the first eight types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Sexual misconduct is committed with the first eight types of consciousness.</p>

<p>Theft may be committed with a hateful thought too. In such a case there is 
the possibility of stealing with the 9th and 10th types of consciousness.</p>

<p>Lying may be uttered with the first ten types of consciousness; and so is 
slandering. </p>

<p>Harsh speech is uttered with the 9th and 10th types of consciousness. Vain 
talk may spring from the first ten types of consciousness. Covetousness springs 
from the first eight types of consciousness. Hatred springs from the 9th and 
10th types of consciousness. False views spring from the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. <b>Eradication of the Akusala Cittas by the four classes of Aryan 
disciples.</b> </p>

<p>A Sotāpanna (Stream-Winner) eradicates the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, and 11th types 
of consciousness as he has destroyed the two Fetters <i>(samyojana)</i>-s<i>akkāya-ditthi</i>
(Self-illusion) and <i>vicikicchā</i> (Doubts). </p>

<p>A Sakadāgāmi (Once-Returner), who has attained the second stage of Sainthood, 
weakens the potentiality of the 9th and 10th types of consciousness, because he 
has only attenuated the two Fetters - <i>kāmarāga</i> (Sense-desire) and <i>
patigha</i>
(Hatred). </p>

<p>An Anāgāmī (Never-Returner), who has attained the third stage of Sainthood, 
eradicates the above two types of consciousness as he has completely destroyed 
the said two Fetters. </p>

<p>An Arahat does not give rise to any of the twelve <i>akusala cittas</i>
as he has eradicated the remaining five Fetters too - namely, <i>rūparāga</i>
(Attachment to <i>rūpa</i> <i>jhānas</i> and Form-Spheres), <i>arūparāga</i>
(Attachment to <i>arūpa jhānas</i> and Formless-Spheres), <i>māna</i> (Conceit), <i>
uddhacca</i>
(Restlessness) and <i>avijjā</i> (Not-knowingness or Ignorance). </p>

</p>

<p>Thus end, in all, the eighteen types of consciousness without <i>Hetu</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven are immoral resultants. Moral resultants are Eightfold. </p>

<p>Three are functionals. <i>Ahetukas</i> are eighteen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Note: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="hetu"></a>23. <b>Hetu</b> is usually rendered by &#39;causal condition&#39;. 
In the Suttas we often come across such phrases as <i>&#39;ko hetu, ko paccayo&#39;,</i>
- &#39;what cause, what reason&#39;. In the Abhidhamma both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i> 
are differentiated and are used in specific senses. The term <i>hetu</i> is 
applied to the six roots explained above. <i>Paccaya</i> is an aiding condition<i> 
(upakāraka dhamma). </i>Like the root of a tree is hetu. <i>Paccaya</i> is like 
water, manure, etc. </p>

<p>The aforesaid eighteen classes of consciousness are called <i>&#39;a-hetuka&#39;</i>
because they are devoid of &#39;concomitant hetus&#39; <i>(sampayuttaka hetu).</i> It 
must be understood that even <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are not devoid of an 
efficient cause <i>(nibbattaka hetu). </i>The remaining 71 classes of 
consciousness are called <i>Sa-hetuka,</i> with Roots. In two there is only one 
Root, in sixty nine there are two or three Roots. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Dvipañcaviññāna</b> - Five pairs of moral and immoral resultant 
consciousness are enumerated here. They are so called because they are dependent 
on the five senses. As they are comparatively weak they are accompanied by 
neutral feeling, with the exception of body-consciousness which is accompanied 
by either pain or happiness. It should be noted that, in the Abhidhamma, these 
five pairs of consciousness are sometimes referred to as <i>&#39;dvipancaviññāna&#39;,</i> 
the two <i>sampaticchana cittas</i>
and <i>pañca-dvārāvajjana citta</i> as <i>&#39;mano dhātu&#39; </i>(mind-element), the 
rest (76) as <i>&#39;mano viññāna dhātu&#39;</i> (mind-consciousness element). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Sampaticchana</b> is that moment of consciousness which accepts or 
receives an object. <i>Santīrana</i> is that which investigates an object. That 
moment of consciousness which turns towards one of the five sense-objects is 
called the <i>pañca-dvārāvajjana. Mano-dvārāvajjana</i> is that moment of 
consciousness which turns the mind towards a mental object. <i>
Pañca-dvārāvajjana</i> and <i>mano-dvārāvajjana</i> are the only two moments of <i>
kiriya cittas</i> experienced by those who are not Arahats. All the other <i>
kiriya cittas</i> are experienced only by Buddhas and Arahats. It is this <i>
mano-dvārāvajjana citta</i> that performs the function of <i>votthapana</i> 
(deciding) which will be dealt with later. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Hasituppāda</b> is a <i>citta</i> peculiar to Arahats. Smiling is 
caused by a pleasurable feeling. There are thirteen classes of consciousness by 
which one may smile according to the type of the person. An ordinary worldling <i>
(puthujjana)</i>
may laugh with either one of the four types of cittas rooted in attachment, 
accompanied by pleasure, or one of the four <i>kusala cittas,</i> accompanied by 
pleasure. </p>

<p>Sotāpannas, Sakadāgāmīs, and Anāgāmīs may smile with one of the two <i>
akusala cittas,</i> disconnected with false view, accompanied by pleasure, or 
with one of the four <i>kusala cittas.</i> </p>

<p>Arahats and Pacceka Buddhas may smile with one of the four <i>sobhana kiriya 
cittas</i> or <i>hasituppāda. </i></p>

<p>Sammā Sambuddhas smile with one of the two <i>sobhana kiriya cittas,</i>
accompanied by wisdom and pleasure. </p>

<p>There is nothing but mere mirth in the <i>hasituppāda</i>
consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Compendium of Philosophy states: &quot;There are six classes of laughter 
recognized in Buddhist works: (1) <i>sita: -</i> a smile manifesting itself in 
expression and countenance; (2) <i>hasita: -</i> a smile consisting in the 
slight movements of the lips just enough to reveal the tips of the teeth; (3) <i>
vihasita: - </i>laughter giving out a light sound; (4) <i>upahasita: - </i>
laughter accompanied by the movement of the head, shoulders, and arms; (5) <i>
apahasita: - </i>laughter accompanied by the shedding of tears; and (6) <i>
atihasita: - </i>an outburst of laughter accompanied by the forward and backward 
movements of the entire body from head to foot. Laughter is thus a form of 
bodily expression<i> (kāya-viññatti),</i> which may or may not be accompanied by 
vocal expression <i>(vacī-viññatti).</i> Of these, the first two classes are 
indulged in by cultured persons, the next two by the average man, and the last 
two by the lower classes of being. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Thought-Process</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subject, the consciousness, receives objects from within and without. 
When a person is in a state of profound sleep his mind is said to be vacant, or, 
in other words, in a state of <i>bhavanga.</i> We always experience such a 
passive state when our minds do not respond to external objects. This flow of <i>
bhavanga</i> is interrupted when objects enter the mind. Then the <i>bhavanga</i> 
consciousness vibrates for one thought-moment and passes away. Thereupon the 
sense-door consciousness <i>(pañca-dvārāvajjana)</i>
arises and ceases. At this stage the natural flow is checked and is turned 
towards the object. Immediately after there arises and ceases the eye 
consciousness* <i>(cakkhu viññāna),</i> but yet knows no more about it. This 
sense operation is followed by a moment of reception of the object so seen <i>
(sampaticchana).</i> Next comes the investigating faculty <i>(santīrana)</i> or 
a momentary examination of the object so received. After this comes that stage 
of representative cognition termed the determining consciousness <i>
(votthapana). </i>Discrimination is exercised at this stage. Freewill plays its 
part here. Immediately after there arises the psychologically most important 
stage - Impulsion or <i>javana.</i> It is at this stage that an action is judged 
whether moral or immoral. <i>Kamma</i> is performed at this stage; if viewed 
rightly <i>(yoniso manasikāra),</i> the <i>javana</i> becomes moral; if viewed 
wrongly <i>(ayoniso manasikāra), </i>it becomes immoral. In the case of an 
Arahat this <i>javana</i> is neither moral nor immoral, but merely functional<i> 
(kiriya).</i> This <i>javana</i> stage usually lasts for seven thought moments, 
or, at times of death, five. The whole process which happens in an infinitesimal 
part of time ends with the registering consciousness <i>(tadālambana),</i>
lasting for two thought-moments - thus completing one thought-process at the 
expiration of seventeen thought-moments. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>*[i.e., if the object is a form<i> (rūpa). </i>This consciousness depends on 
the five objects of sense.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three kinds of <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness are <i>vipāka.</i>
They are either one of the two <i>santīrana cittas,</i> accompanied by 
indifference, mentioned above, or one of the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas,</i> 
described in section 6. <i>Pañca-dvārāvajjana</i> is a <i>kriyā citta. Pañca 
viññāna</i> is one of the ten moral and immoral <i>vipāka cittas.</i> <i>
Sampaticchana</i> and <i>santīrana</i>
are also <i>vipāka cittas.</i> The <i>mano-dvārāvajjana</i> (mind-door 
consciousness), a <i>kriyā citta,</i> functions as the <i>votthapana</i> 
consciousness. One can use one&#39;s freewill at this stage. The seven <i>javana</i> 
thought-moments constitute <i>kamma.</i>
The <i>tadālambana</i> is a <i>vipāka citta</i> which is one of the three <i>
santīrana cittas</i> or one of the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus in a particular thought-process there arise various thought-moments 
which may be <i>kamma, vipāka,</i> or <i>kriyā</i>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THOUGHT PROCESS: According to Abhidhamma when an object is presented to the 
mind through one of the five doors a thought process runs as follows:- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moral, resultant, and functional types of consciousness of the sensuous

<p>&nbsp;</p>

knowledge. Com. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Pāpa</b> - is that which leads to misery. Evil or bad is a better 
rendering than sin which has a Christian outlook. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Hetuka</b> - All the <i>cittas</i> that are to be described hereafter, 
are called <i>sahetukas,</i> with Roots, opposed to the <i>ahetukas</i> of the 
foregoing section. Of the twenty-four <i>kāmāvacara sobhana cittas,</i> twelve 
are connected with two good Roots: generosity <i>(alobha)</i> and 
loving-kindness <i>(adosa);</i>
twelve with three good: hetus - generosity, loving-kindness, and knowledge <i>
(amoha).</i>

<p>According to the commentary one does a good act on the spur of the moment 
without any particular inducement either from within or without, owing to 
physical and mental fitness, due to good food, climate, etc., and as a result of 
having performed similar actions in the past. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. All good acts are done by one of these first eight <i>cittas.</i>
Their corresponding effects are the eight resultant <i>cittas.</i> The eight <i>
ahetuka vipāka cittas</i> are also the due effects of these <i>kusala cittas.</i> 
It, therefore, follows that there are sixteen <i>vipāka cittas</i> corresponding 
to eight <i>kusala cittas,</i> whereas in the case of twelve <i>akusala cittas</i> 
there are only seven <i>ahetuka vipāka cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Buddhas and Arahats also experience all these twenty-three types of
<i>vipāka cittas</i> as they are bound to reap the good and bad effects of their 
past actions till they die. But they do not experience the first eight <i>kusala 
cittas</i> as they do not accumulate fresh <i>kamma</i> that has any 
reproductive power, since they have eradicated all fetters that bind oneself to 
existence. When they do any good act, instead of the usual <i>kusala cittas,</i> 
they experience the eight <i>kriyā cittas</i> which possess no reproductive 
energy. Ordinary persons and even Holy Ones of the first three grades of Saint 
ship do not experience these eight <i>cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. Illustrations for the first eight <i>kusala cittas:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. One understandingly gives something to a beggar at once with joy. </p>

<p>2. One understandingly gives something to a beggar with joy, after 
deliberation, or being induced by another. </p>

<p>3. A child, without any understanding, joyfully salutes a monk at once. 
Joyfully a person automatically recites a Sacred Text without understanding the 
meaning. </p>

<p>4. A child, without any understanding, joyfully salutes a monk, as instructed 
by the mother. A person joyfully repeats a Sacred Text, as taught by another, 
without understanding the meaning. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining four types should be understood in the same way, substituting 
indifference for joy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Rūpāvacara- </b></p>

<p>There are three planes of existence-namely, Sensuous Sphere <i>(kāmaloka),
</i>Form-Sphere <i>(rūpaloka),</i> and Formless-Sphere <i>(arūpaloka).</i> The 
four states of misery <i>(apāya),</i> human realm <i>(manussa),</i> and the six 
celestial realms <i>(devaloka)</i> constitute the <i>kāmaloka. </i>It is so 
called because sense-desires play a predominant part in this sphere. The four 
states of misery are called
<i>duggati</i> (evil states). Evil-doers are born in such states. The remaining 
seven are called <i>sugati</i> (good states). The good are born in these states 
of sensuous bliss. </p>

<p>The more evolved persons, who seek no delight in ordinary sense-desires, but 
are interested in higher spiritual progress, must naturally be born in congenial 
places in harmony with their lofty aspirations. Even in the human realm it is 
they who retire to solitude and engage themselves in meditation. </p>

<p>Such meditation <i>(bhāvanā)</i> is of two kinds - <i>samatha</i>
(concentration) and <i>vipassanā</i> (insight). <i>Samatha,</i> which means 
calm, or tranquillity is gained by developing the Jhānas. <i>Vipassanā</i> is 
seeing things as they truly are. With the aid of Jhānas one could develop higher 
psychic powers <i>(abhiññā).</i>
It is <i>vipassanā</i> that leads to Enlightenment. </p>

<p>Those who develop Jhānas are born after death in higher Form-Spheres <i>
(rūpaloka)
</i>and Formless-spheres <i>(arūpaloka). </i></p>

<p>In the Formless-Spheres there is no body but only mind. As a rule, both mind 
and body are interrelated, interdependent, and inseparable. But by will-power 
there is a possibility for the mind to be separated from the body and vice versa 
temporarily. Beings born in celestial realms and Form-Spheres are supposed to 
posses very subtle material forms. </p>

<p>The Compendium of Philosophy states that &quot;<i>Rūpaloka</i> is so called 
because the subtle residuum of matter is said, in that place of existence, to be 
still met with. Arūpaloka is so called because no trace of matter is held to be 
found in it&quot;. </p>

<p>That which frequents the <i>Rūpa-</i>Sphere is <i>rūpāvacara.</i>
There are fifteen <i>cittas</i> pertaining to it. Five are <i>kusalas,</i> which 
one can develop in this life itself. Five are their corresponding <i>vipākas</i> 
which are experienced after death in the <i>Rūpa-</i>sphere. Five are <i>kriyā 
cittas,</i> which are experienced only by Buddhas and Arahats either in this 
life or by Arahats in the <i>Rūpa</i>-Sphere.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Jhāna</b> - Sanskrit <i>dhyāna</i>- </p>

<p>The Pāli term is derived from the root <i>&quot;jhe&quot;,</i> to think. Venerable 
Buddhaghosa explains Jhāna as follows, <i>&quot;Aramman&#39;upanijjhānato 
paccanīkajhāpanato vajhanam&quot;, </i>Jhāna is so called because it thinks closely 
of an object or because it burns those adverse things (hindrances - <i>
nīvaranas).</i></p>

<p>By Jhāna is meant willful concentration on an object. </p>

<p>Of the forty objects of concentration, enumerated in the 9th chapter of this 
book, the aspirant selects an object that appeals most to his temperament. This 
object is called <i>parikamma nimitta</i> - preliminary object. </p>

<p>He now intently concentrates on this object until he becomes so wholly 
absorbed in it that all adventitious thoughts get <i>ipso facto</i> excluded 
from the mind. A stage is ultimately reached when he is able to visualize the 
object even with closed eyes. On this visualized image <i>(uggaha nimitta)</i> 
he concentrates continuously until it develops into a conceptualized image <i>
(patibhāga nimitta). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an illustration let us take the <i>pathavī kasina.</i></p>

<p>A circle of about one span and four inches in diameter is made and the 
surface is covered with dawn-colored clay and smoothed well. If there be not 
enough clay of the dawn color, he may put in some other kind of clay beneath. 
This hypnotic circle is known as the <i>parikamma nimitta.</i> Now he places 
this object about two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on it, 
saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavī</i> or earth. The purpose is to gain 
the one-pointedness of the mind. When he does this for some time - perhaps 
weeks, or months, or years - he would be able to close his eyes and visualize 
the object. This visualized object is called <i>uggaha nimitta.</i> Then he 
concentrates on this visualized image, which is an exact mental replica of the 
object, until it develops into a conceptualized image which is called <i>
patibhāga nimitta.</i> </p>

<p>The difference between the first visualized image and the conceptualized 
image is that in the former the fault of the device appears, while the latter is 
clear of all such defects and is like a &quot;well-burnished conchshell&quot;. The latter 
possesses neither color nor form. &quot;It is just a mode of appearance, and is born 
of perception&quot;. </p>

<p>As he continually concentrates on this abstract concept he is said to be in 
possession of &quot;proximate concentration&quot; <i>(upacāra samādhi) </i>and the innate 
five Hindrances to progress <i>(nīvarana),</i> such as sense-desire <i>
(kāmacchanda),</i>
hatred <i>(patigha),</i> sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha),</i> restlessness 
and brooding <i>(uddhacca-kukkucca), </i>and doubts <i>(vicikicchā)</i> are 
temporarily inhibited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually he gains &quot;ecstatic concentration&quot; <i>(appanā samādhi)</i> and 
becomes enwrapped in Jhāna, enjoying the calmness and serenity of a one-pointed 
mind. </p>

<p>As he is about to gain <i>appanā samādhi</i> a thought process runs as 
follows:- <i>bhavanga, mano-dvārāvajjana, parikamma, upacāra, anuloma, gotrabhū, 
appanā. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the stream of consciousness is arrested, there arises the Mind-door 
consciousness taking for its object the <i>patibhāga nimitta.</i> This is 
followed by the Javana process which, as the case may be, starts with either <i>
parikamma</i>
or <i>upacāra.</i> <i>Parikamma</i> is the preliminary or initial 
thought-moment. <i>Upacāra</i>
means proximate, because it is close to the <i>appanā samādhi.</i> It is at the <i>
anuloma</i>
or &quot;adaptation&quot; thought-moment that the mind qualifies itself for the final <i>
appanā.</i>
It is so called because it arises in conformity with <i>appanā.</i> This is 
followed by <i>gotrabhū,</i>
the thought-moment that transcends the <i>kāma</i>-plane. <i>Gotrabhū</i> means 
that which subdues <i>(bhū)</i> the Kāma-lineage <i>(gotra).</i> All the 
thought-moments of this Javana process up to the <i>gotrabhū</i> moment are <i>
kāmāvacara</i> thoughts. Immediately after this transitional stage of <i>
gotrabhū</i> there arises only for a duration of one moment the <i>appanā</i> 
thought-moment that leads to ecstatic concentration. This consciousness belongs 
to the <i>Rūpa</i>-plane, and is termed the First <i>Rūpa</i> Jhāna. In the case 
of an Arahat it is a <i>kriyā citta,</i> otherwise it is a <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This consciousness lasts for one thought-moment and then subsides into the <i>
Bhavanga</i> state. </p>

<p>The aspirant continues his concentration and develops in the foregoing manner 
the second, third, fourth, and fifth Jhānas. </p>

<p>The five Jhāna <i>vipākas</i> are the corresponding Resultants of the five 
Morals. They are experienced in the Form sphere itself and not in the <i>Kāma</i>-sphere.
<i>Kusala</i> and <i>Kiriyā</i> Jhānas could be experienced in the <i>Kāma</i>-sphere 
continuously even for a whole day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The five factors, <i>vitakka, vicāra, pīti, sukha, ekaggatā</i>
collectively found in the <i>appanā</i> consciousness, constitute what is 
technically known as Jhāna. In the second Jhāna the first factor is eliminated, 
in the third the first two are eliminated, in the fourth the first three are 
eliminated, while in the fifth even happiness is abandoned and is substituted by 
equanimity. </p>

<p>Sometimes these five Jhānas are treated as four, as mentioned in the 
Visuddhi-Magga. In that case the second Jhāna consists of three constituents as 
both <i>vitakka</i>
and <i>vicāra</i> are eliminated at once. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Vitakka</b> - is derived from <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>
&quot;takk&quot;</i> to think. Generally the term is used in the sense of thinking or 
reflection. Here it is used in a technical sense. It is that which directs the 
concomitant states towards the object. <i>(ārammanam vitakketi sampayuttadhamme 
abhiniropeti&#39; ti vitakko).</i> Just as a king&#39;s favourite would conduct a 
villager to the palace, even so <i>vitakka</i> directs the mind towards the 
object. </p>

<p><i>Vitakka</i> is an unmoral mental state which, when associated with a
<i>kusala</i> or <i>akusala citta,</i> becomes either moral or immoral. A 
developed form of this <i>vitakka</i> is found in the first Jhāna consciousness. 
A still more developed form of <i>vitakka</i> is found in the Path-consciousness <i>
(magga citta)</i> as <i>sammā-sankappa</i>
(Right thoughts). The <i>vitakka</i> of the Path-consciousness directs the 
mental states towards Nibbāna and destroys <i>micchā</i> (wrong or evil) <i>
vitakka</i> such as thoughts of sense-desire <i>(kāma), </i>thoughts of hatred <i>
(vyāpāda),</i> and thoughts of cruelty <i>(vihimsā).</i> The <i>vitakka</i> of 
the Jhāna consciousness temporarily inhibits sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha)</i> 
one of the five Hindrances <i>(nīvarana).</i></p>

<p>Through continued practice the second Jhāna is obtained by eliminating
<i>vitakka.</i> When four Jhānas are taken into account instead of the five, the 
second Jhāna is obtained by eliminating both <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> at 
the same time.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Vicāra</b> is derived from <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> + <i>&quot;car&quot;</i>
to move or wander. Its usual equivalent is investigation. Here it is used in the 
sense of sustained application of the mind on the object. It temporarily 
inhibits doubts <i>(vicikicchā).
</i></p>

<p>According to the commentary <i>vicāra</i> is that which moves around the 
object. Examination of the object is its characteristic. <i>Vitakka</i> is like 
the flying of a bee towards a flower. <i>Vicāra</i> is like its buzzing around 
it. As Jhāna factors they are correlates. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Pīti</b> is zest, joy, or pleasurable interest. It is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>&quot;pi&quot;,</i> to please, to delight. It is not a kind of feeling <i>
(vedanā)</i> like <i>sukha.</i> It is, so to say, its precursor. Like the first 
two Jhāna factors, <i>(pīti)</i> is also a mental state found in both moral and 
immoral consciousness. Creating an interest in the object is its characteristic <i>
pīti</i>
inhibits <i>vyāpāda,</i> ill-will or aversion. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are five kinds of <i>pīti:- </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. <i>Khuddaka pīti,</i> the thrill of joy that causes &quot;the flesh to 
	creep&quot;. </p>
    <p>2. <i>Khanika pīti,</i> instantaneous joy like a flash of lightning. </p>
    <p>3. <i>Okkantika pīti,</i> the flood of joy like the breakers on a 
	seashore. </p>
    <p>4. <i>Ubbega pīti,</i> transporting joy which enables one to float in the 
	air just as a lump of cotton carried by the wind. </p>
    <p>5. <i>Pharana pīti,</i> suffusing joy, which pervades the whole body like 
	a full blown bladder or like a flood that overflows small tanks and ponds. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>41. <b>Sukha</b> is bliss or happiness. It is a kind of pleasant feeling. It 
is opposed to <i>uddhacca</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> (restlessness and brooding). 
As <i>vitakka</i> is the precursor of <i>vicāra,</i> so is <i>pīti</i> the 
precursor of <i>sukha.</i>
</p>

<p>The enjoyment of the desired object is its characteristic. It is like a king 
that enjoys a delicious dish. </p>

<p><i>Pīti</i> creates an interest in the object, while <i>sukha</i>
enables one to enjoy the object. </p>

<p>Like the sight of an oasis to a weary traveler, is <i>pīti.</i> Like drinking 
water and bathing therein, is <i>sukha</i>. </p>

<p>This mental <i>sukha</i> which should be differentiated from <i>ahetuka 
kāyika</i> (physical) happiness is identical with <i>somanassa.</i> But it is a 
joy disconnected with material pleasures. This pleasurable feeling is the 
inevitable outcome of renouncing them <i>(nirāmisa sukha). </i>Nibbānic bliss is 
yet far more subtle than Jhānic bliss. There is no feeling in experiencing the 
bliss of Nibbāna. The total release from suffering<i> (dukkhūpasama) </i>is 
itself Nibbānic bliss. It is comparable to the &quot;ease&quot; of an invalid who is 
perfectly cured of a disease. It is a bliss of relief. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="42-Upekkha">42. <b>Upekkhā</b></a> - literally, means seeing <i>
(ikkhati) </i>impartially
<i>(upa = yuttito).</i> It is viewing an object with a balanced mind, 
Atthasālini states: - &quot;This is impartiality <i>(majjhattam)</i> in connection 
with the object, and implies a discriminative knowledge <i>(paricchindanakam 
ñānam)&quot;.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This explanation applies strictly to <i>upekkhā</i> found in <i>sobhana</i>
consciousness accompanied by wisdom. <i>Upekkhā</i> found in the <i>akusalas</i> 
and <i>ahetukas</i>
is just neutral feeling, without the least trace of any discriminative 
knowledge. In the <i>kāmāvacara sobhanas,</i> too, there may arise that neutral 
feeling, as in the case of one hearing the Dhamma without any pleasurable 
interest, and also a subtle form of <i>upekkhā</i> that views the object with 
deliberate impartiality and discriminative knowledge, as in the case of a wise 
person who hears the Dhamma with a critical and impartial mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> of the Jhāna consciousness, in particular is of ethical and 
psychological importance. It certainly is not the ordinary kind of <i>upekkhā,</i>
generally found in the <i>akusala</i> consciousness which comes naturally to an 
evil-doer. The Jhāna <i>upekkhā</i> has been developed by a strong will-power. 
Realizing that pleasurable feeling is also gross, the Yogi eliminates it as he 
did the other three Jhāna factors, and develops the more subtle and peaceful <i>
upekkhā.</i> On the attainment of the fifth Jhāna breathing ceases. As he has 
transcended both pain and pleasure by will-power, he is immune to pain too. </p>

<p>This <i>upekkhā</i> is a highly refined form of the ordinary <i>
tatramajjhattatā,</i>
even-mindedness, one of the moral mental states, latent in all types of <i>
sobhana</i>
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Pāli phrase - <i>upekkhā satipārisuddhi</i> - purity of mindfulness 
which comes of equanimity - it is the <i>tatra-majjhattatā</i> that is referred 
to. This is latent in the first four Jhānas too. In the fifth Jhāna this <i>
tatra-majjhattatā</i>
is singled out and becomes highly refined. Both neutral feeling <i>upekkhā 
vedanā)</i>
and equanimity that correspond to the one Pāli term <i>upekkhā</i> are found in 
the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus there appear to be four kinds of <i>upekkhā</i> viz:- (1) just neutral 
feeling, found in the six <i>akusala cittas,</i> (2) sensitive passive neutral 
feeling <i>(anubhavana upekkhā)</i> found in the eight <i>ahetuka</i> sense-door 
consciousness <i>(dvipañca-viññāna)</i><font SIZE="2"> (excluding <i>
kāyaviññāna)</i></font>, (3) intellectual <i>upekkhā,</i> found mostly in the 
two <i>sobhana kriyā cittas,</i>
accompanied by knowledge, and sometimes in the two <i>sobhana kusala cittas,</i>
accompanied by knowledge, (4) ethical <i>upekkhā,</i> found in all the <i>
sobhana cittas,</i>
especially in the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Brahmavihārupekkhā</i> and <i>sankhārupekkhā</i> may be included in both 
intellectual and ethical <i>upekkhā. </i></p>

<p>The first is equanimity amidst all vicissitudes of life. The second is 
neither attachment nor aversion with respect to all conditioned things. </p>

<p>Visuddhi-Magga enumerates ten kinds of <i>upekkhā.</i> See the Path of Purity 
-Vol. II pp. 184-186. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. <b>Ekaggatā</b> <i>(eka + agga + tā) </i>lit., one-pointedness. This is a 
mental state common to all Jhānas. By <i>sammā samādhi</i> (Right Concentration) 
is meant this <i>ekaggatā</i> found in the Path-consciousness. <i>Ekaggatā</i>
temporarily inhibits sensual desires. </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="page58"></a> 44. <b>Arūpa Jhāna</b>-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Yogi who has developed the <i>Rūpa</i> Jhānas and who wishes to develop 
the <i>Arūpa</i> Jhānas now concentrates on the Patibhāga Nimitta mentioned in 
the previous section. As he does so, a faint light, like a fire fly, issues from 
the Kasina object. He wills it to expand until it covers the whole space. Now he 
sees nothing but this light pervading everywhere. This developed space is not a 
reality but a mere concept. In Pāli this space is called <i>kasinugghātimākāsa</i> 
(space issuing forth from the Kasina object). On this concept he concentrates 
thinking &quot;<i>ākāso ananto</i>&quot;, &#39;Infinite is space&#39;, until he develops the first <i>
Arūpa</i> <i>Jhāna</i>-<i>ākāsānañcāyatana</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As in the case of the <i>Rūpa</i> Jhānas a thought-process, runs as follows:- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>mano-dvārāvajjana, parikamma, upacāra, anuloma, gotrabhū,</p>
    <p>ākāsānañcāyatana. </p>
    </i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Parikamma</i> thought-moment may or may not occur. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <i>Arūpa</i> Jhāna thought-moment occurs only for a moment, and then the 
consciousness lapses into <i>Bhavanga</i> consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again he concentrates on the first <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> thinking <i>&quot;viññānam 
anantam&quot;, </i>&#39;Infinite is Consciousness&#39; until he develops the second <i>Arūpa 
Jhāna</i> - <i>&quot;viññānañcāyatana&quot;. </p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To develop the third <i>Arūpa Jhāna - &quot;ākiñcaññāyatana&quot;</i> - the Yogi takes 
for his object the first <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness and thinks - <i>
&#39;Natthi kiñci&#39;,</i> &quot;There is nothing whatever&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fourth <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness is developed by taking the third <i>
Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness as the object. The third <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i>
is so subtle and refined that one cannot definitely say whether there is a 
consciousness or not. As he concentrates thus on the third consciousness he 
develops the fourth Jhāna. Although the term <i>&quot;saññā&quot;</i> is used here, <i>
vedanā, </i>(feeling) and <i>sankhārā,
</i>(mental states) are also included therein. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The five <i>Rūpa Jhānas</i> differ according to the Jhāna factors. These four <i>
Arūpa</i> <i>Jhānas,</i> on the other hand, differ according to the objects of 
concentration. The first and the third have two concepts <i>(paññatti). </i>They 
are the concept of the &#39;infinity of space&#39; and the concept of &#39;nothingness&#39;. The 
second and the fourth Jhāna consciousness have for their objects the first and 
the third Jhāna respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These four <i>Arūpa Jhānas</i> have their corresponding effects in the <i>
Arūpa</i> spheres. The four <i>Kriyā Jhānas</i> are experienced only by Buddhas 
and Arahats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all these twelve <i>Jhāna Cittas</i> are found the two Jhāna factors - <i>
Upekkhā</i> and <i>ekaggatā</i> - equanimity and one-pointedness that constitute 
the fifth <i>Rūpa Jhāna. </i></p>

Thus end, in all, the eight types of supra mundane Moral and Resultant 
consciousness. Differing according to the four Paths, the Moral Consciousness is 
fourfold. So are the Resultants, being their fruits. The Supra mundane should be 
understood as eightfold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Sensuous Sphere, they say, are fifty-four types of consciousness, in

<p>§ 10. These different classes of consciousness, which thus number 
eighty-nine, the wise divide into one hundred and twenty-one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does consciousness which is analyzed into eighty-nine become one hundred 
and twenty-one? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The First <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with initial 
application, sustained application, joy, happiness, and one-pointedness,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. The Second <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with 
sustained application, joy, happiness, and one-pointedness, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. The Third <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with joy,

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. The Fourth <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the five types of <i>Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So are the Sakadāgāmī Path-consciousness, Anāgāmī Path-consciousness, and 
Arahatta Path-consciousness, making exactly twenty classes of consciousness. 
Similarly there are twenty classes of Fruit-consciousness. Thus there are forty 
types of supra mundane consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Dividing each (supra mundane) consciousness into five kinds according to 
different Jhāna factors, the supra mundane consciousness, it is said, becomes 
forty. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. As the Form-Sphere consciousness is treated as first Jhāna consciousness 
and so on, even so is the supra mundane consciousness. The Formless-Sphere 
consciousness is included in the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Thus the Jhānas beginning from the first amount to eleven, they say. The 
last Jhāna (i.e., the fifth ) totals twenty-three. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Thirty-seven are Morals, fifty-two are Resultants; thus the wise say that 
there are one-hundred and twenty-one types of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus ends the first chapter of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha which deals with 
the Analysis of the Consciousness </p>

<hr>

<p>45. <b>The Realization of Nibbāna.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Yogi who wishes to realize Nibbāna tries to understand things as they 
truly are. With his one-pointed mind he scrutinizes his self and, on due 
examination, discovers that his so-called &quot;Ego-personality&quot; is nothing but a 
mere composition of mind and matter - the former consisting of fleeting mental 
states that arise as a result of the senses coming into contact with the 
sense-stimuli, and the latter of forces and qualities that manifest them-selves 
in multifarious phenomena. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of his self, freed from 
the false notion of an identical substance of mind and matter, he attempts to 
investigate the cause of this &quot;Ego-personality.&quot; He realizes that everything 
worldly, himself not excluded, is conditioned by causes past or present, and 
that this existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>
(tanhā),</i> attachment <i>(upādāna),</i>
Kamma, and physical food <i>(āhāra)</i> of the present life. On account of these 
five causes this personality has arisen and as the past activities have 
conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. Meditating 
thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to the past, present, and future <i>
(kankhā-vitarana-visuddhi).</i>
Thereupon he contemplates that all conditioned things are transient <i>(anicca),</i>
subject to suffering <i>(dukkha), </i>and devoid of an immortal soul <i>
(anattā).</i>
Wherever he turns his eyes, he sees nothing but these three characteristics 
standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a mere flowing, continuous 
undivided movement. Neither in a celestial plane nor on earth does he find any 
genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to pain. What is 
transient is therefore subject to suffering and where change and sorrow prevail 
there cannot be a permanent ego. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he is thus absorbed in meditation, a day comes when, to his surprise, he 
witnesses an aura emanating from his body <i>(obhāsa). </i>He experiences an 
unprecedented pleasure, happiness, and quietude. He becomes evenminded and 
strenuous. His religious fervour increases, and mindfulness becomes perfect, and 
Insight extraordinarily keen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress for Sainthood, chiefly owing 
to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking for this mental state. Soon 
the realization comes that these new developments are only obstacles to moral 
progress and he cultivates the &#39;purity of Knowledge&#39; with regard to the &#39;Path&#39; 
and &#39;Non-path&#39; <i>(maggāmagga-ñānadassana visuddhi). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of conditioned things. Of these 
two characteristics the latter becomes more impressed in his mind, because 
change is more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he turns his attention to 
the contemplation of the dissolution of things <i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He 
perceives that both mind and matter, which constitute his personality, are in a 
state of constant flux, not remaining for two consecutive moments the same. To 
him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving things are fearful <i>(bhaya 
ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a pit of burning embers, a source 
of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava 
ñāna)</i> of the fearful world and feeling disgusted with it <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i>
wishes to escape therefrom <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this object in view, he meditates again on the three characteristics <i>
(patisankhā ñāna),</i> and thereafter becomes completely indifferent to all 
conditioned things - having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly 
object <i>(sankhārupekkhā ñāna). </i>Reaching this point of mental culture, he 
takes for his object of special endeavour one of the three characteristics that 
appeals to him most, and intently keeps on developing insight in that particular 
direction, until that glorious day when, for the first time, he realizes 
Nibbāna, his ultimate goal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <i>Javana</i> thought-process then runs as follows:</p>

    <td width="17%">
    <p><i>Phala</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When there is no <i>Parikamma</i> thought-moment, in the case of an 
individual with keen Insight, there arise three <i>Phala</i> thought-moments. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These nine kinds of Insight, viz:- <i>Udaya, Vaya, Bhanga, Bhaya, ādīnava, 
Nibbidā, Muñcitukamyatā, Patisankhā, Sankhārupekkhā </i>and <i>Anuloma ñāna</i> 
are collectively called <i>&quot;Patipadā ñānadassana Visuddhi&quot; </i>- Purity of 
Knowledge and Vision as regards the Practice. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insight found in this Supra mundane Path - Consciousness is known as <i>
Ñānadassana Visuddhi </i>- Purity of Knowledge and Vision. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time, he is called 
a Sotāpanna - One who has entered the Stream that leads to Nibbāna for the first 
time. He is no more a <a NAME="page68">worldling</a> <i>(puthujjana)</i> but an 
Ariya. He eliminates three Fetters - namely, Self-illusion <i>(sakkāya ditthi),</i> 
Doubts <i>(vicikicchā),</i>
and Adherence to Wrongful Rites and Ceremonies <i>(sīlabbata parāmāsa). </i>As 
he has, not eradicated all the Fetters that bind him to existence, he is reborn 
seven times at the most. In his subsequent birth he may or may not be aware of 
the fact that he is a Sotāpanna. Nevertheless, he possesses the characteristics 
peculiar to such a Saint. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha, and would 
never violate any of the five Precepts. He is moreover absolved from states of 
woe, for he is destined to Enlightenment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summoning up fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, 
the Aryan pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight becomes a 
Sakadāgāmī. (Once-Returner), by attenuating two other Fetters -namely, 
Sense-desire<i>
(kāmarāga) </i>and Ill-will <i>(patigha). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, too, and in the case of the other two advanced stages of 
Sainthood, a <i>javana</i> thought-process runs as above, but the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is termed <i>&quot;vodāna&quot;</i> (pure) as the individual is purified. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Sakadāgāmī is reborn on earth only once in case he does not attain 
Arahatship in that life itself. It is interesting to note that the pilgrim who 
has attained the second stage of Sainthood can only weaken these two powerful 
fetters with which he is bound from a beginningless past. Occasionally he may be 
disturbed by thoughts of lust and anger to a slight extent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is by attaining the third stage of Sainthood, Anāgāmī (State of a 
Never-Returner), that he completely discards the above two Fetters. Thereafter 
he neither returns to this world nor does he seek birth in celestial realms, 
since he has rooted out the desire for sensual pleasures. After death he is 
reborn in the &quot;Pure Abodes&quot; <i>(suddhāvāsa)</i>
environment reserved for Anāgāmīs and Arahats. There he attains Arahatship and 
lives till the end of his life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the earnest pilgrim, encouraged by the unprecedented success of his 
endeavours, makes his final advance and destroying the remaining five Fetters - 
namely, Attachment to Form-sphere <i>(rūparāga), </i>Attachment to Formless 
Sphere <i>(arūpa rāga),</i> Conceit <i>(māna),</i> Restlessness <i>(uddhacca),</i> 
and Ignorance <i>(avijjā),
</i>attains Arahatship, the final stage of Sainthood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be noted that the Fetters have to be eradicated in four stages. The 
Path <i>(magga) </i>thought-moment occurs only once. The Fruit <i>(phala)</i> 
thought moment immediately follows. In the Supra mundane classes of 
consciousness the effect of the <i>kusala cittas</i> is instantaneous. Hence it 
is called <i>akālika</i> (of immediate fruit); whereas in the case of <i>lokiya 
cittas</i> effects may take place in this life, or in a subsequent life, or at 
any time till one attains Parinibbāna.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Mundane consciousness Kamma is predominant, while in the Supra mundane <i>
paññā</i> or wisdom is predominant. Hence the four <i>kusala lokuttara</i> <i>
cittas</i>
are not treated as Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These eight <i>cittas</i> are called <i>lokuttara</i>. Here Loka means the <i>
Pañcupādana-kkhandha</i>, the five Aggregates of Attachment. <i>Uttara</i> means 
that which transcends. <i>Lokuttara</i> therefore means that which transcends 
the world of Aggregates of Attachment. This definition strictly applies to the 
Four Paths. The Fruits are called <i>Lokuttara</i> because they have transcended 
the world of Aggregates of Attachment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. <b>Forty Types of Lokuttara Cittas:</b>- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One who has attained the First Jhāna emerges from it and meditates on the 
impermanence, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of those mental states in that 
particular consciousness and ultimately realizes Nibbāna. As the First Jhāna was 
made the basis to realize Nibbāna this <i>lokuttara kusala</i> thought is 
called- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>Vitakka-Vicāra-Pīti-Sukh&#39;Ekaggatā-sahitam 
	  Pathamajjhāna-Sotāpattimagga-cittam. </p>
    </i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This <i>magga</i> thought-moment is immediately followed by the <i>phala</i>
thought-moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same manner the other four Jhānas are made the bases to realize 
Nibbāna. Now, for each stage there are five Paths and five Fruits according to 
the different Jhānas. For the four stages there are forty classes of 
consciousness. </p>
