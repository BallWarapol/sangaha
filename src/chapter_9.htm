<h3>Compendium of Subjects for Mental Culture: (I)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introductory verse</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. Hereafter I will explain the twofold subject of mental culture which 
deals with Calm (2) and Insight (3). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Compendium of Calm)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 2. Of the two, in the Compendium of Calm, to with, the objects of mental 
culture are sevenfold: A. the ten Kasinas, B. the ten Impurities, C. The ten 
Reflections, D. the four Illimitables, E. the one Perception, F. the one 
Analysis, G. the four <i>arūpa-jhānas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six kinds of temperaments (4): 1. the lustful, 2. the hateful, 3. the 
unintelligent, or ignorant, 4. the devout, or faithful, 5. the intellectual, or 
wise, 6. the discursive. </p>

<p>The three stages of Mental Culture: 1. the preliminary (5), 2 . the 
proximate, 3. the concentrative. </p>

<p>The three signs (6): 1. the preliminary, 2. the abstract, 3. the 
conceptualized. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How ? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. The ten kasinas (7) are; earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, 
  white, space, and light. </p>
  <p>B. The ten Impurities (8) are: a bloated (corpse), a discoloured (corpse), 
  a festering, (corpse), a dissected (corpse), an eaten (corpse), a 
  scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a mutilated and scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a 
  bloody (corpse), a worm-infested (corpse), and a skeleton. </p>
  <p>C. The ten Reflections (9) are: 1. The Reflection on the Buddha, 2. The 
  Reflection on the Doctrine, 3. The Reflection on the order, 4. The Reflection 
  on morality, 5. The Reflection on generosity, 6. The Reflection on deities, 7. 
  The Reflection on peace, 8. The Reflection on death, 9. Mindfulness regarding 
  the body, 10. Mindfulness regarding breathing (10). </p>
  <p>D. The four Illimitables, also called Sublime States, (11), are: 
  loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity. </p>
  <p>E. The one Perception is the feeling of loathsomeness about food (12). </p>
  <p>F. The one Analysis is the analysis of the four elements (13). </p>
  <p>G. The four <i>arūpa-jhānas</i> are the &#39;Infinity of Space&#39; (14) and so 
  forth. In the exposition of &#39;Calm&#39; there are altogether forty (15) subjects of 
  meditation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suitability of Subjects for different Temperaments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. With respect to temperaments the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness 
regarding the body&#39;, such as the 32 parts, are suitable for those of a lustful 
temperament (16). </p>

<p>The four &#39;Illimitables&#39; and the four colored <i>kasinas</i> are suitable for 
those of a hateful temperament (17). </p>

<p>The reflection on &#39;Breathing&#39; is suitable for those of an unintelligent and 
discursive temperament.</p>

<p>The six Reflections on the Buddha and so forth are suitable for those of a 
devout temperament; Reflection on &#39;Death&#39;, &#39;Peace&#39;, &#39;Perception&#39;, and 
&#39;Analysis&#39;, for those of an intellectual temperament, and all the remaining 
subjects of mental culture, for all. </p>

<p>Of the <i>kasinas</i> a wide one is suitable for the unintelligent, and a 
small one for the discursive.</p>

<p>Herein this is the section on suitability. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stages of Mental Culture</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. The preliminary stage of mental culture is attainable in all these 
forty; subjects of meditation. In the ten subjects of mental culture such as the 
eight Reflections on the Buddha and so forth and the one &#39;Perception&#39;, and the 
one &#39;Analysis&#39; (18) only proximate mental culture is attained but not the 
concentrative stage. In the thirty remaining subjects of mental culture the 
concentrative stage of mental culture is also attained. </p>

<p>Therein the ten <i>kasinas</i> and the &#39;Breathing&#39; produce five <i>jhānas;</i>
the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness regarding the body&#39; only the first <i>
jhāna;</i>
the first three &#39;Illimitables&#39; such as loving-kindness, four <i>jhānas;</i> 
&#39;equanimity&#39; (19) the fifth <i>jhāna.</i></p>

<p>Thus these twenty-six subjects of mental culture produce <i>rūpa-jhānas.</i>
</p>

<p>The four &#39;formless&#39; objects produce the <i>arūpa-jhānas.</i></p>

<p>This is the section on mental culture. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Signs of Mental Culture</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 5. Of the three signs, the preliminary sign and the abstract sign are 
generally obtained in every case according to the object. But the conceptualized 
image is obtained in the <i>&#39;Kasinas&#39;</i>, &#39;Impurities&#39;, &#39;Parts of the body&#39;, 
and &#39;Breathing&#39;. </p>

<p>It is by means of the conceptualized image that the proximate on pointedness 
and the ecstatic one-pointedness are developed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How? </p>

<p>Whatever object amongst the earth kasinas and so forth, a beginner takes to 
practice meditation, is called a preliminary sign and that meditation is 
preliminary mental culture. When that sign is perceived by the mind and enters 
the mind-door as if seen by the very (physical) eye then it is called the 
abstract sign. That meditation becomes well established.</p>

<p>Likewise when a counter-image born of mediation, freed from original defects 
(20) reckoned as a concept, is well established and fixed in the mind of one who 
is well composed and who thereafter, practices meditation on the abstract sign 
by means of preliminary concentration then it is said that the conceptualized 
image has arisen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rūpa Jhāna</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thereafter &#39;proximate concentration&#39;, free from obstacles, pertaining to the <i>
kāma</i>-Sphere, arises. Then he who develops the conceptualized image by means 
of &#39;proximate concentration&#39; attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> of the <i>rūpa</i>-Sphere.
</p>

<p>Thenceforth by bringing that very first <i>jhāna</i> under one&#39;s sway by 
means of these five kinds of mastery (21) - namely, reflection, attainment, 
resolution, emergence, and revision - the striving person, by inhibiting the 
coarse factors like &#39;initial application&#39; and so forth, and by developing the 
subtle factors like &#39;sustained application and so forth attains, by degrees, 
according to circumstances, to the second <i>jhāna</i>
and so forth. </p>

<p>Thus with respect to twenty-two subjects of mental culture such as the earth 
kasina, etc., the conceptualized image is obtained. But in the remaining 
(eighteen) subjects of mental culture the &#39;Illimitables&#39; relate to the concept 
of beings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arūpa Jhāna (22)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, to one who practices concentration on space abstracted from any <i>
kasina</i>
excluding the <i>ākāsa kasina,</i> thinking - &#39;this is infinite&#39; - there arises 
the first <i>arūpa</i> <i>jhāna.</i> To one who practices concentration on that 
very first <i>arūpa jhāna,</i> thinking that &#39;it is infinite&#39;, there arises the 
second <i>arūpa jhāna.</i>
To one who practices concentration on the non-existence of the first <i>arūpa</i>-consciousness, 
the thinking &#39;there is naught whatever&#39; - there arises the third <i>arūpa jhāna.</i> 
To him who practices concentration on the third <i>arūpa</i> consciousness, 
thinking &#39;it is calm, it is sublime&#39;, there arises the fourth <i>arūpa jhāna. </i></p>

<p>In the remaining ten subjects of mental culture when concentration is 
practiced on an object like the attributes of the Buddha and so forth and when 
the sign is well grasped &#39;preliminary meditation&#39; becomes steadfast therein and 
&#39;proximate meditation&#39; is also accomplished. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supernormal Knowledge (23)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emerging from the fifth jhāna (serving as a) basis for supernormal knowledge, 
and reflecting on the &#39;resolution&#39; and so forth, when one practices 
concentration on physical objects, etc., there arises according to 
circumstances, the fifth <i>rūpa-jhāna</i> induced in the way of developing 
supernormal knowledge. </p>

<p>The five kinds of supernormal knowledge are: Various Psychic Powers, 
Celestial Ear, Discerning other&#39; thoughts, Reminiscence of past births, and 
Celestial Eye.
</p>

<p>Herein this is the section mental culture. </p>

<p>The method of meditation on Calm is ended. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Kammatthāna</b> - Here this term is used in a technical sense. Kamma 
means the act of meditation or contemplation. <i>Thāna,</i> literally, station, 
ground, or occasion, implies subjects or exercises. <i>Kammatthāna,</i> 
therefore, means &#39;subjects of meditation&#39; or &#39;meditation exercises&#39;. There are 
forty such subjects of meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Samatha</b> derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sam,</i>
to lull, to subdue, denotes &#39;tranquillity&#39; &#39;quietude&#39;, gained by subduing the 
Hindrances. It is synonymous with concentration <i>(samādhi) </i>which leads to 
the development of <i>jhānas.</i>
By concentration passions are only temporarily inhibited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Vipassanā,</b> derived from <i>vi + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
dis,</i> to see, literally means perceiving in diverse ways, that is in the 
light of transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness. It is rendered by 
&#39;insight&#39;, &#39;contemplation&#39;, &#39;intuition&#39;, &#39;introspection&#39;. The sole object see 
things as they truly are, in Emancipation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Carita</b> signifies the intrinsic nature of a person, which is 
revealed when one is in a normal state without being preoccupied with anything. 
The temperaments of people differ owing to the diversity of their actions or 
Kammas. Habitual actions tend to form particular temperaments. </p>

<p><i>Rāga</i> (lust) is predominant in some, while <i>dosa</i> (anger, hatred 
or ill will), in others. Most people belong to these two categories. There are a 
few others who lack intelligence and are more or less ignorant <i>(moha-carita).</i> 
Akin to the ignorant are those whose minds oscillate, unable to focus their 
attention deliberately on one thing <i>(vitakka-carita).</i> By nature some are 
exceptionally devout
<i>(saddhā-carita), </i>while others are exceptionally intelligent <i>
(buddhi-carita). </i></p>

<p>Thus, in brief, there are six kinds of temperaments.</p>

<p>By combining them with one another, we get 63 types. With the inclusion of <i>
ditthi-carita</i> (speculative temperament) there are 64. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. The preliminary stages of mental development are termed <i>
parikamma-bhāvanā</i>. Mental culture, from the moment one develops the 
conceptualized image and temporarily inhibits the Hindrances, until the <i>
gotrabhū</i> thought-moment in the <i>jhāna javana</i>
process, is termed <i>upacāra-bhāvanā</i>. </p>

<p>The thought-moment that immediately follows the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is called <i>appanā,</i> ecstatic concentration, because vitakka 
(initial application), the foremost <i>jhāna</i> constituent, persists as if 
firmly fixed upon the object of concentration. </p>

<p><i>Jhāna</i> Thought-Process: <i>manodvārāvajjana / parikamma, upacāra, 
anuloma, gotrabhū, appanā / bhavanga.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Any object, such as a <i>kasina,</i> used for preliminary mental culture 
is termed <i>&#39;parikamma-nimitta&#39;. </i></p>

<p>The same object, when mentally perceived with closed eyes, is termed <i>
&#39;uggaha-nimitta&#39;.
</i></p>

<p>The identical visualized image, freed from all <i>kasina</i> defects, is 
termed <i>&#39;patibhāganimitta&#39;</i> when it serves as an object of <i>upacāra</i> 
and <i>appanā bhāvanā.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Kasina</b> means &#39;whole, &#39;all, &#39;complete&#39;. It is so called because the 
light issuing from the conceptualized image is extended everywhere without any 
limitation.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>pathavi-kasina</i> one makes a circle of about one span and 
four fingers in diameter and, covering it with dawn-coloured clay, smoothes it 
well. If there be not enough clay of dawn-coloured, he may put in some other 
kind of clay beneath. This prepared circle is known as <i>kasina-mandala</i> and 
is also called <i>parikamma-nimitta.</i>
Now he places this object two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on 
it, saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavi, pathavi</i> or earth, earth. The 
purpose is to gain one-pointedness of mind. When he does this for some time, 
perhaps weeks, or months, or years, he will be able to close his eyes and 
visualize the object. This visualized object is called <i>&#39;uggaha-nimitta&#39;.</i> 
Then he concentrates on this visualized image until it develops into a 
conceptualized or counter-image free from original <i>kasina</i> faults. This is 
known as the &#39;patibhāganimitta&#39;. As he continually concentrates on this abstract 
concept he is said to be in possession of proximate or neighborhood 
concentration <i>(upacāra-samādhi).</i>
At this stage the innate five Hindrances are temporarily inhibited. Eventually 
he gains &#39;ecstatic concentration&#39; <i>(appanā samādhi). </i></p>

<p>For the water-<i>kasina</i> one may take a vessel full of colourless water, 
preferably rain water, and concentrate on it, saying - <i>āpo, āpo,</i> (water, 
water) until he gains one-pointedness of mind. </p>

<p>To develop the fire-<i>kasina</i> one may kindle a fire before him and 
concentrate on it through a hole, a span and four fingers in diameter, in a 
rush-mat, a piece of leather, or a piece of cloth, saying <i>tejo, tejo,</i> 
(fire, fire). </p>

<p>One who develops the air-<i>kasina</i> concentrates on the wind that enters 
through window space or a hole in the wall, saying, <i>vāyo, vāyo</i> (air, 
air).
</p>

<p>To develop the colour-<i>kasinas</i> one may take a <i>mandala</i> of the 
prescribed size, and colour it blue, yellow, red, or white and concentrate on 
it, repeating the name of the colour as in the case of the other <i>kasinas. </i></p>

<p>One may even concentrate on blue, yellow, red, or white flowers. </p>

<p>Light <i>kasina</i> may be developed by concentrating on the moon, or on an 
unflickering lamplight, or on a circle of light cast on the ground, or on the 
wall by sunlight or moonlight entering through a wall-crevice or hole, saying - <i>
āloka, āloka</i> (light, light). </p>

<p>Space-kasina can be developed by concentrating on a hole, a span and four 
fingers in diameter, in either a well-covered pavilion or a piece of leather, or 
a mat, saying, <i>okāsa, okāsa</i> (space, space). </p>

<p>It may be mentioned that light and space <i>kasinas</i> are not mentioned in 
the Texts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Asubha</b> - Those ten kinds of corpses were found in ancient Indian 
cemeteries and charnel places where dead bodies were not buried or cremated and 
where flesh-eating animals frequented. In modern days they are out of the 
question. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Anussati</b> - literally, means repeated reflection or constant 
mindfulness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. <b>Buddhānussati</b> is the reflection on the virtues of the Buddha as, 
  for example: &quot;Such indeed is that Exalted One, Worthy, Fully Enlightened, 
  Endowed with Wisdom and Conduct, Well-farer, Knower of the Worlds, an 
  Incomparable Charioteer for the training of individuals, Teacher of gods and 
  men, Omniscient, and Holy&quot;.</p>
  <p>ii. <b>Dhammanussati</b> is reflection on the virtues of the Doctrine as, 
  for example: &quot;Well-expounded is the doctrine by the Exalted One, to be 
  realized by oneself, of immediate fruit, inviting investigation, leading to 
  Nibbāna, to be understood by the wise, each one for himself&quot;. </p>
  <p>iii. <b>Sanghānussati</b> is the reflection on the virtues of the pure 
  members of the Noble Celibate Order as follows: &quot;Of good conduct is the Order 
  of the disciples of the Exalted One; of upright conduct is the Order of the 
  disciples of the Exalted One; of wise conduct is the Order of the disciples of 
  the Exalted One; of dutiful conduct is the Order of the disciples of the 
  Exalted One. The four pairs of persons constitute eight individuals. This 
  Order of the disciples of the Exalted One is worthy of offerings, is worthy of 
  hospitality, is worthy of gifts, is worthy of reverential salutation, is an 
  incomparable field of merit for the world&quot;. </p>
  <p>iv. <b>Sīlānussati</b> is reflection on the one&#39;s own virtuous conduct.</p>
  <p>v. <b>Cāgānussati</b> is reflection on one&#39;s own charitable nature. </p>
  <p>vi. <b>Devatānussati</b> - &quot;Deities are born in such exalted states on 
  account of their faith and other virtues. I too possess them.&quot; Thus when one 
  reflects again and again on one&#39;s own faith and others&#39; virtues, placing 
  deities as witnesses, it is called Devatānussati.</p>
  <p>vii. <b>Upasamānussati</b> is reflection on the attributive qualities of 
  Nibbāna, such as the cessation of suffering, etc.</p>
  <p>viii. Maranānussati is reflection on the termination of psycho physical 
  life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Contemplation on death enables one to comprehend the fleeting nature of 
	life. When one understands that death is certain and life is uncertain one 
	endeavors to make the best use of one&#39;s life by working for self-development 
	and for the development of others, instead of wholly indulging in sensual 
	pleasures. Constant meditation on death does not make one pessimistic and 
	lethargic but, on the contrary, it makes one more active and energetic. 
	Besides one can face death with serenity. </p>
    <p>While contemplating death, one may think that life is like a flame, or 
	that all so-called beings are the outward temporary manifestations of the 
	invisible Karmic energy, just as an electric light is the outward 
	manifestation of the invisible electric energy. Choosing various similes, 
	one may meditate on the uncertainty of life and on the certainty of death. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>ix. Kāyagatāsati is reflection on the 32 impure parts of the body such as 
  hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, etc. This meditation on the 
  loathsomeness of the body, leads to dispassion. Many Bhikkhus in the time of 
  the Buddha attained Arahatship by meditating on these impurities. If one is 
  not conversant with all the thirty-two parts, one may meditate on one part 
  such as bones. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Within this body is found a skeleton. It is full of flesh which is 
	covered with a skin. Beauty is nothing but skin deep. When one reflects thus 
	on the impure parts of the body passionate attachment to this body gradually 
	disappears. </p>
    <p>This meditation may not appeal to those who are not sensual. They may 
	meditate on the innate creative possibilities of this complex machinery of 
	man. </p>
    <p>The thirty-two parts of the body are enumerated as follows: </p>
    <p>&quot;Hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinew, bones, marrow, 
	kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, bowels, mesentery, stomach, 
	faeces, brain, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, lymph, tears, grease, 
	saliva, nasal mucus, articular fluid, and urine&quot;. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>x. <b>ānāpānasati</b> is mindfulness on respiration. <i>āna</i>
  means inhalation and <i>apāna</i> exhalation. In some books these two terms 
  are explained in the reverse way. Concentration on the breathing process leads 
  to one-pointedness of the mind, and ultimately to Insight which leads to 
  Arahatship. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>10. This is one of the best subjects of meditation, which appeals equally to 
all. The Buddha also practiced <i>ānāpānasati</i> before His Enlightenment. </p>

<p>A detailed exposition of this meditation is found in the Satipatthāna Sutta 
and in the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p>A few practical hints are given here for the benefit of the average reader. </p>

<p>Adopting a convenient posture, breathe out and close the mouth. Then breathe 
in through the nostrils calmly, without strain. Inhale first and count mentally 
one. Exhale and count two, concentrating on the breathing process. In this 
manner count up to ten, constantly focusing your attention on respiration. It is 
possible for the mind to wander before one counts up to ten. But one need not be 
discouraged. Try again until success is achieved. Gradually one can increase the 
number of series, say five series of ten. Later one can concentrate on the 
breathing process without counting. Some prefer counting as it aids 
concentration; while others prefer not to count. What is essential is 
concentration, and not counting, which is secondary. When one does this 
concentration exercise one feels light in body and mind and very peaceful. One 
might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. When one practices this 
concentration for a certain period, a day may come when one will realize that 
his so-called body is supported by mere breath, and that the body perishes when 
breathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes impermanence. Where there is change 
there cannot be a permanent entity or an immortal soul. Insight might then be 
developed to gain Arahatship. </p>

<p>It is now clear that the object of this concentration on respiration is not 
merely to gain one-pointedness but also to cultivate Insight in order to obtain 
Deliverance. </p>

<p>This simple method may be pursued by all without any harm. </p>

<p>For more details readers are referred to the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p>In some Suttas this simple method of respiration is explained as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Attentively he breathes in, attentively he breathes out. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. When making a long inhalation he knows, &#39;I make a long inhalation; 
		when making a long exhalation, he knows, &#39;I make a long exhalation&#39;. </p>
        <p>2. When making a short inhalation he knows, &#39;I make a short 
		inhalation&#39;; when making a short exhalation he knows, &#39;I make a short 
		exhalation&#39;. </p>
        <p>3. &#39;Clearly perceiving the entire (breath) body <i>
		(sabbakāyapatisamvedi),</i>
        I will inhale&#39;: thus he trains himself; &#39;clearly perceiving the entire 
		(breath) body. I will exhale&#39;: thus he trains himself. </p>
        <p>4. &#39;Calming this breathing process <i>(passam bhayam kāyasankhāram),</i>
        I will inhale&#39; thus he trains himself; &#39;calming this breathing process, 
		I will exhale&#39;: thus he trains himself. </p>

<p>11. <b>Brahmavihāra</b> - Here Brahma means sublime, as in <i>brahmacariya</i>
(sublime life). <i>Vihāra</i> means mode or &#39;state of conduct&#39; or &#39;state of 
living&#39;. They are also termed <i>appamaññā</i> (limitless, boundless) because 
these thoughts are radiated towards all beings, without limit or obstruction. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. <b>Mettā</b> (Sanskrit: Maitri) loving-kindness, benevolence, goodwill - 
  is defined as that which softens one&#39;s heart. It is not carnal love or 
  personal affection. The direct enemy of Mettā is hatred, ill will or aversion <i>
  (kodha); </i>its indirect enemy is personal affection <i>(pema).</i> Mettā 
  embraces all beings without exception. The culmination of Mettā is the 
  identification of oneself with all beings <i>(sabbattatā).</i>
  It is the wish for the good and happiness of all. Benevolent attitude is its 
  chief characteristic. It discards ill will. </p>
  <p>ii. <b>Karunā</b> - compassion - is defined as that which makes the hearts 
  of the good quiver when others are subject to suffering, or that which 
  dissipates the sufferings of others. Its chief characteristic is the wish to 
  remove the sufferings of others. Its direct enemy is wickedness <i>(himsā) </i>
  and its indirect enemy is passionate grief <i>(domanassa)</i> Compassion 
  embraces sorrow-stricken beings, and it eliminates cruelty. </p>
  <p>iii. <b>Muditā</b> is not mere sympathy but sympathetic or appreciative 
  joy. Its direct enemy is jealousy, and its indirect enemy is exhilaration <i>
  (pahāsa).</i>
  Its chief characteristic is happy acquiescence in others&#39; prosperity and 
  success <i>(anumodanā).</i>
  Muditā embraces prosperous beings. It eliminates dislike <i>(arati) </i>and is 
  the congratulatory attitude of a person. </p>
  <p>iv. <b>Upekkhā</b> literally, means to view impartially, that is, with 
  neither attachment nor aversion. It is not hedonic indifference but perfect 
  equanimity or a well-balanced mind. It is the balanced state of mind amidst 
  all vicissitudes of life such as praise and blame, pain and happiness gain and 
  loss, repute and disrepute. Its direct enemy is attachment<i> (rāga)</i> and 
  its indirect enemy is callousness. Upekkhā discards clinging and aversion. 
  Impartial attitude is its chief characteristic. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here Upekkhā does not mean mere neutral feeling, but implies a sterling 
	virtue. Equanimity, mental equilibrium, are its closest equivalents. Upekkhā 
	embraces the good and the bad, the loved and the unloved, the pleasant and 
	the unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>See Chapter 2, note 4. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>12. <b>āhāre patikkūlasaññā</b> - i.e., the feeling of loathsomeness of food, 
in its search, eating, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Catudhātuvavatthānam</b> - i.e., the investigation of the four primary 
elements of extension, cohesion, heat, and motion, with regard to their 
characteristics, etc. 14. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Arūpajhānas</b> - See Ch. 1. They are: (i) &#39;The Realm of the Infinity 
of Space&#39;, (ii) &#39;The Realm of the Infinity of Consciousness&#39;, (iii) &#39;The Realm 
of Nothingness&#39;, and (iv) The &#39;Realm of neither Perception nor Non-perception&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. Thirty-eight objects when &#39;light&#39; and &#39;space&#39; are excluded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. Because they tend to create a disgust for the body which fascinates the 
senses. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. Because the objects are deep and vast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. These objects are too coarse, and vitakka, one of the constituents of <i>
jhāna,</i> is an indispensable aid to practice concentration on them. As there 
is no <i>vitakka</i> in the remaining four <i>jhānas,</i> they cannot be 
developed by concentrating on these two objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. As equanimity <i>(upekkhā)</i> is found only in the fifth <i>jhāna,</i>
the first four <i>jhānas</i> cannot be developed by concentrating on this last 
&#39;Illimitable&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Vatthudhammato</b> - i.e., from the defects found in the original <i>
kasina-mandala. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>āvajjana</b> - reflection on the different constituents of <i>jhāna.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Samāpajjana</b> - the ability to attain to different <i>jhānas</i>
quickly. </p>

<p><b>Adhitthāna</b> - the ability to remain in the <i>jhānas</i> as long as one 
likes. </p>

<p><b>Vutthāna</b> - the ability to emerge from the <i>jhānas</i> as quickly as 
possible. </p>

<p><b>Paccavekkhana</b> is similar to āvajjana. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. See Ch. 1, p. <a HREF="#page58">*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Abhiññā</b> - Only one who has gained the fifth <i>jhāna</i>
can develop the following five kinds of supernormal knowledge or vision: </p>

<p>i. <b>Iddhividha</b> - Flying through the air, walking on water, diving into 
the earth, creation of forms, etc., belong to this category. </p>

<p>ii. <b>Dibbasota</b> is the Celestial Ear, also called clairaudience, which 
enables one to hear subtle or coarse sounds far or near. </p>

<p>iii. <b>Paracittavijānana</b> is the power to discern the thoughts of others. </p>

<p>iv. <b>Pubbenivāsānussati</b> is the power to remember the past lives of 
oneself and others. This is the first supernormal vision the Buddha developed 
during the first watch on the night. He attained Enlightenment. With regard to 
this knowledge the Buddha&#39;s power is limitless, while in the case of others it 
is limited. </p>

<p>v. <b>Dibbacakkhu</b> is the Celestial or Divine Eye, also called 
clairvoyance, which enables one to see heavenly or earthly things, far or near, 
which are imperceptible to the physical eye. This as the second knowledge the 
Buddha developed during the second watch on the night of His Enlightenment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cutūpapātañāna knowledge with regard to the dying and reappearing of 
beings, is identical with this Celestial Eye. <i>Anāgatamsañāna,</i>
knowledge with regard to the future, and <i>yathākammūpagañāna,</i> knowledge 
with regard to the faring of beings according to their own good and bad actions, 
are two other kinds of knowledge belonging to the same category. These come 
within the range of Buddha&#39;s Omniscience. </p>

<p>These five kinds of supernormal vision are worldly. To these should be added 
the sixth supernormal knowledge - <i>āsavakkhayañāna</i> - knowledge with regard 
to the extinction of passions which is supramundane. </p>

<p>The first five kinds may be developed at any period; but the last, only 
during a Buddha-cycle. </p>

<p>Different Kind of Purity</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 6. In the exercises on mental culture pertaining to Insight (24) the 
section on &#39;Purity&#39; is sevenfold: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Purity of Morals, </p>
    <p>2. Purity of Mind, </p>
    <p>3. Purity of views, </p>
    <p>4. Purity of Transcending Doubts, </p>
    <p>5. Purity of Vision in discerning the Path and Non-Path, </p>
    <p>6. Purity of Vision in discerning the method, </p>
    <p>7. Purity of Vision regarding intuitive wisdom. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three Characteristic Marks: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The Characteristic Mark of Impermanence (25), </p>
    <p>2. The Characteristic Mark of Suffering (26), and </p>
    <p>3. The Characteristic Mark of No-soul (27). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three Contemplations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The Contemplation on Impermanence, </p>
    <p>2. The Contemplation on Suffering, and </p>
    <p>3. The Contemplation on No soul. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are ten kinds of Insight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Investigating knowledge (28), </p>
    <p>2. Knowledge with regard to the arising and passing away (of conditioned 
	things), </p>
    <p>3. Knowledge with regard to the dissolution (of things), </p>
    <p>4. Knowledge (of dissolving things) as fearful, </p>
    <p>5. Knowledge of (fearful) things as baneful, </p>
    <p>6. Knowledge of (baneful) things as disgusting, </p>
    <p>7. Knowledge as regards the wish to escape from them, </p>
    <p>8. Knowledge of reflecting contemplation (9), </p>
    <p>9. Knowledge of equanimity towards conditioned things (30), and </p>
    <p>10. Knowledge of adaptation (31). </p>
    <p>There are three Emancipations (32): </p>
    <p>1. Emancipation through Void (33), </p>
    <p>2. Emancipation through Signlessness (34); and </p>
    <p>3. Emancipation through Desirelessness (3)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three Doors of Emancipation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Contemplation on the Void, </p>
    <p>2. Contemplation on the Signlessness, and </p>
    <p>3. Contemplation on Desirelessness. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>How?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Purity of Morals (36) consists of four kinds of perfect discipline, namely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Moral Discipline as regards the Fundamental Precepts, </p>
    <p>2. Discipline as regards sense-restraint, </p>
    <p>3. Discipline as regards purity of livelihood, </p>
    <p>4. Discipline as regards the four requisites. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Purity of Mind (37) consists of two kinds of concentration, namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. &#39;proximate concentration&#39;, and </p>
    <p>2. &#39;established or ecstatic concentration&#39;. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Purity of Views (38) is the understanding of mind and matter with respect to 
their characteristics, function, mode of appearance, and proximate cause. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Purity of Transcending Doubts (39) is the comprehension of the causes of 
those very mind and matter. </p>

<p>After comprehending the causes, the meditator, considering the methods of 
aggregates, etc., formulates in groups the conditioned things of the triple 
plane, that have arisen with causes, differing according to the past, etc., and 
that have been comprehended in the foregoing manner. Now he meditates on the 
three characteristics - impermanence in the sense of dissolution, suffering in 
the sense of fearfulness, and soullessness in the sense of unsubstantiality - by 
way of duration, continuity, and momentariness. To him who meditates on the 
arising and passing away of things by means of the knowledge so named with 
respect to causes and momentariness there arise - </p>

<p>an aura, joy, quietude, excessive faith, effort, happiness, wisdom, 
mindfulness equanimity and a liking (for that state). </p>

<p>Purity of Vision in discerning what is the Path and what is not the Path 
(40), is the determining of characteristics of Path and not Path by 
understanding an aura etc., as inimical impediments of insight. </p>

<p>Getting rid of these inimical impediments, the meditator reflects on the 
three Characteristics. Now to him, starting from the knowledge of arising and 
passing away, and extending up to the knowledge of adaptation, there arise in 
one continuous stream of contemplation, nine kinds of Insight. By Purity of 
Vision that discerns the method (41) is meant these nine kinds of knowledge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Realization</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When he thus practices contemplation, owing to the ripening of insight (he 
feels) &#39;Now the development (of the path) (42) will arise&#39;. Thereupon arresting 
the life-continuum, arises mind-door consciousness, followed by two or three 
(moments of) insight consciousness having for their object any of the 
Characteristics such as impermanence etc. They are termed &#39;preliminary&#39;, 
&#39;proximate&#39;, and &#39;adaptation&#39; (moments) (43). </p>

<p>That knowledge of equanimity towards conditioned things, together with 
knowledge that conforms (to the truths), when perfected, is also termed &#39;Insight 
of emergence leading to the Path (44). </p>

<p>There after the <i>gotrabhū</i>-consciousness (45), having Nibbāna as its 
object occurs, overcoming the lineage of the worldlings, and evolving the 
lineage of the Ariyas*. <a NAME="page414"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The thought-process of a Stream-Winner: manodvārāvajjana - parikamma - 
upacāra - anuloma - gotrabhū - magga - phala - phala - bhavanga.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immediately after that consciousness, the Path (of the Stream-Winner)*, 
realizing the Truth of suffering, eradicating the Truth of its cause, realizing 
the Truth of its cessation, and developing the Truth of the Way to its 
cessation, descends into the (supramundane) <i>appanā</i> thought-process. </p>

<p>After that Path-consciousness two or three moments of Fruit-consciousness 
arise and subside into the life-continuum (46). Then, arresting the 
life-continuum, the knowledge of reflection occurs. </p>

<p>The wise man reflects (47) on the Path, Fruit, Nibbāna, defilements 
destroyed, and either reflects or does not reflect on the remaining defilements. </p>

<p>Thus the fourfold Path which has to be developed by degrees by means of the 
sixfold purity is called the &#39;Purity of Intuitive Knowledge&#39; (48). </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Purity. </p>

<p>24. <b>Vipassanā</b> or Insight is the third and final stage on the Path of 
Sainthood. The chief object of Insight is to understand things as they truly 
are. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Anicca,</b> i.e., the fleeting nature of both mind and matter. 
Changeableness is a characteristic of everything that is conditioned. All 
conditioned things are constantly changing, not remaining static for two 
consecutive moments. Mind, in fact, changes even faster than matter. Normally 
matter endures only for seventeen thought-moments. Commentators state that, 
during the time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments 
may arise. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Dukkha</b> - All conditioned things are subject to suffering. Birth is 
suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering. Union 
with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant is suffering. Not 
to get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates of 
attachment are suffering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Anattā</b> - Or Soullessness is the crux of Buddhism. As there is no 
permanent entity in matter, so also there is no unchanging entity in mind 
conceived as an &#39;ego&#39; or soul&#39;. In everything mundane and supramundane 
conditioned and non-conditioned, there is no permanent soul. Hence the Buddha in 
the Dhammapada stated <i>&#39;sabbe dhammā anattā</i> - all dhammas are soulless&#39;. 
With regard to <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i>
the Buddha said <i>&#39;sankhārā</i> - conditioned things&#39;. With regard to <i>
anattā,</i>
the Buddha employed the term <i>dhammā</i> to include supramundane unconditioned 
Nibbāna as well. </p>

<p>It may be mentioned that it was after hearing the &#39;Anattalakkhana Sutta&#39;, the 
discourse on soullessness, that the first five monks attained Arahatship. </p>

<p>The aspirant does not usually meditate on all these three characteristics. Of 
them, he takes only that which appeals to him most. Deliverance, gained by 
meditating on one of them, is named accordingly. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Sammasanañana</b> - Lit., &#39;handling-knowledge&#39;, is the investigating 
of aggregates as composite <i>(kalāpavasena). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Patisankhāñāna</b> is the recontemplation of conditioned things in 
order to find out the means to escape the refrom. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</b> is perfect equanimity towards all conditioned 
things, having neither attachment nor aversion, resulting from developing the 
foregoing different kinds of Insight. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Anuloma-ñāna</b> is the &#39;adaptation knowledge&#39; gained by perfecting 
the foregoing nine kinds of Insight. It is so called because it conforms itself 
to 37 Factors of Enlightenment and qualifies the aspirant for the higher path. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Vimokkha</b> - so called because the deliver one from the ten Fetters, 
etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Suññata</b> - devoid of a soul. Emancipation gained by meditating on 
soullessness <i>(anattā) </i>is called <i>suññata-vimokkha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Animitta</b> - free from the signs of permanence, etc. Emancipation 
gained by meditating on &#39;impermanence&#39; <i>(anicca)</i> is called <i>
animitta-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. <b>Appanihita</b> - free from the hankering of craving. Emancipation 
gained by meditating on &#39;suffering&#39; <i>(dukkha) </i>is called <i>
appanihita-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Sīlavisuddhi</b> - Purity of Morals, is the first of seven &#39;Purities&#39;. 
It consists of four kinds, all pertaining to the life of a Bhikkhu.</p>

<p>The first is <i>pātimokkhasamvarasīla.</i> &#39;That which saves one who observes 
it from woeful states&#39; is the commentarial explanation of <i>&#39;pātimokkha&#39;.</i> <i>
Pā</i>
is also explained as the Buddhas Teaching. <i>Atipamokkha</i> means extremely 
important. <i>Pātimokkha</i>
therefore means &quot;Fundamental Teaching&quot; or &quot;Fundamental Precepts&quot;. It deals with 
220* disciplinary rules which every Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it 
restrains one from evil deeds, etc., it is termed <i>&#39;samvara&#39;.</i> Sīla is used 
in the sense of &#39;composure&#39; <i>(samādhāna) </i>and &#39;support&#39; <i>(upadhārana).</i> 
It is so called because it tends to discipline thoughts, words, and deeds, and 
because it acts as a support for other virtues. <i>Indrivasamvarasīla</i> the 
second <i>sīla,</i> deals with the control of the six senses. <i>
ājīvapārisuddhisīla,</i> the third <i>sīla,</i>
deals with the right livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the necessaries of 
life, a Bhikkhu should not act in an unbecoming way. <i>Paccayasannissitasīla</i> 
the fourth <i>sīla,</i>
is concerned with the unselfish use of the four requisites - robes, alms, 
lodging, and medicine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*227 including seven ways of settling disputes
(adhikarana samatha dhamma).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Cittavisuddhi</b> - is the second &#39;Purity. It is the purity of mind, 
gained by developing the <i>jhānas,</i> temporarily inhibiting the Hindrances. A 
purified mind is like a polished mirror where everything is reflected in its 
true perspective. With a purified mind one can see things as they truly are. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Ditthivisuddhi</b> - is the third &#39;Purity&#39;. It is so called because it 
purifies one from the false theory of a permanent soul. This correct 
comprehension results from investigating mind and matter as regards their 
salient characteristics <i>(lakkhana),</i> function or essential properties <i>
(rasa),</i> the way of manifestation <i>(paccupatthāna),</i> and their immediate 
cause <i>(padatthāna). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Kankhāvitaranavisuddhi</b> - is the fourth &#39;Purity&#39; which attempts to 
transcend skeptical doubts as regards cause and effect, the past, the present, 
and the future. This is called a purity because it removes the stain of 
erroneous views of &#39;chance&#39;, causelessness&#39;, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this purity one meditates on the various causes that tend to 
produce present mind and matter, and on the causes that sustain them in the 
present. He understands that present mind and matter at conception were 
conditioned by past ignorance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, during 
lifetime, matter is conditioned by kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and edible 
food, while mind is sustained by the senses and their corresponding objects. 
Thus he realizes the second noble truth of the cause of suffering and rids 
himself of doubts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi</b> - This is the fifth &#39;Purity&#39;. </p>

<p>The aspirant ho has cleared his doubts, meditates again with better 
understanding on the three characteristics of <i>anicca, dukkha,</i> and <i>
anattā.</i>
He realizes that life is a mere flowing, a continuous undivided movement. He 
finds no genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to 
pain. What is transient is painful, and where change and sorrow prevail there 
cannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising and passing away of conditioned 
things become very conspicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed in meditation he 
witnesses an aura <i>(obhāso)</i> emanating from his body as a result of his 
keen insight. He experiences also an unprecedented joy <i>(pīti),
</i>happiness <i>(sukha),</i> and quietude <i>(passaddhi).</i> He becomes 
strenuous <i>(paggaho)
</i>and even-minded <i>(upekkhā).</i> His religious fervour increases <i>
(adhimokkha),</i>
mindfulness <i>(sati) </i>strengthens, and wisdom <i>(ñāna)</i> ripens. Laboring 
under the misconception that he has attained Sainthood, chiefly owing to the 
presence of the aura, he yearns <i>(nikanti)</i> for this state of mind. Soon he 
realizes that these temptations are only impediments <i>(upakkilesa) </i>to 
Insight, and that he has not really attained Sainthood. Accordingly he 
endeavours to distinguish between the right and wrong path <i>
(maggāmaggañānadassana).</i> It is called a &#39;purity because it clears up the 
misconception as regards the actual &#39;path&#39;. He understands, &#39;This is the right 
path, that is the wrong path&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Patipadāñānadassanavisuddhi</b> - is the sixth &#39;Purity&#39;. This term is 
collectively applied to the nine kinds of Insight beginning with the knowledge 
as regards the arising and passing away of conditioned things, and ending with 
the knowledge of adaptation that occurs in the Path thought-moment immediately 
preceding the <i>gotrabhū</i>
moment. (See p. <a HREF="#page429">*</a>, footnote ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <b>Appanā</b> - the supramundane Path <i>(lokuttara-magga). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. See pp. <a HREF="#page218">218*</a>, <a HREF="#page414">414*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. <b>Vutthānagāminīvipassanā</b> - is the name given to both <i>
sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</i>
and <i>anuloma-ñāna</i> of the ten kinds of Insight. It is so called because it 
leads to the Path emerging from woeful states and signs of conditioned things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. <b>Gotrabhū</b> - lit, means &#39;overcoming the worldly lineage&#39;. The object 
of this thought-moment is Nibbāna, but the actual realization of Nibbāna by the 
eradication of passions occurs at the Path thought-moment that immediately 
follows. This particular thought-moment in the three higher stages of Sainthood 
is termed <i>&#39;vodāna&#39;</i>
(pure) as the aspirant is already an Ariya. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. Immediately after the <i>gotrabhū</i> thought-moment there arises the 
Path thought-moment of the Sotāpanna. It is at this stage that one comprehends 
the Truth of Suffering, eradicates craving, the cause of suffering, and actually 
realizes Nibbāna for the first time in his life. The eight factors that 
constitute the Noble Path are also fully developed at this stage. This 
particular thought-moment is termed <i>&#39;sotāpatti-magga&#39;.</i>
<i>Sota</i> here means the stream that leads to Nibbāna. It is the Noble 
Eightfold Path. <i>āpatti</i>
means &#39;entering for the first time&#39;. It is called <i>&#39;magga&#39;</i> because it 
arises, destroying the passions. This Path thought-moment arises only once in 
the course of one&#39;s lifetime, and is immediately followed by two or three 
&#39;Fruit&#39; <i>(phala)</i> moments before the stream of consciousness lapses into <i>
bhavanga.</i> This is the reason why the Dhamma is called <i>&#39;akālika&#39;</i> 
(immediately effective). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. <b>Paccavekkhanañānāni</b> - As a rule after each of the four stages of 
Sainthood one reflects on the Path and Fruit one has attained, on the Nibbāna 
one has realized, on the defilements one has destroyed, and in the case of the 
first three stages, on the defilements one has yet to destroy. An Arahat who has 
no more defilements to destroy knows that he is delivered. </p>

<p>There are altogether 19 kinds of such reflective knowledge, 15 pertaining to 
the first three stages of Sainthood, and 4 to the last stage. </p>

<p>The Pāli phrase - <i>n&#39;āparam itthatthāya</i> - No more of this state again - 
refers to this process of reflection. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>48. <b>Nānadassanavisuddhi</b> is the name given to the contemplative 
knowledge, a mental state of wisdom found in the Path-Consciousness. It is 
called a &#39;purity&#39;, because it is completely free from all stains or defilements, 
resulting from the realization of the four Truths. It is the seventh &#39;purity&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emancipation</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 7. Therein, the contemplation of no-soul, that discards the clinging to a 
soul (49), becomes an avenue of Emancipation and is termed &#39;Void-contemplation&#39;. 
The contemplation of impermanence, that discards the signs of false notion (50), 
becomes an avenue of Emancipation, and is termed &#39;Signless-contemplation. The 
contemplation of suffering, that discards the hankering of attachment (51), 
becomes an avenue of Emancipation and is termed &#39;Unhankering-contemplation&#39; . </p>

<p>Hence if with the Emergence Insight leading to the Path, one contemplates on 
no-soul, then the Path is known as &#39;Void-Emancipation&#39;; if one contemplates on 
impermanence then the Path is known as &#39;Signless-Emancipation; if one 
contemplates on sorrow, then the Path is known as &#39;Unhankering-Emancipation. 
Thus the Path receives three names according to the way of Insight. Likewise, 
the Fruit, (occurring) in the Path thought-process, receives these three names 
according to the way of the Path. </p>

<p>However, in the thought-process as regards the attainment to fruition, to 
those who contemplate in the foregoing manner, the Fruits that arise 
respectively in each case, are termed &#39;Void-Emancipation&#39;, etc., only in 
accordance with the way of Insight. But, as regards objects and respective 
functions, the triad of names is applied equally to all (Paths and Fruits) 
everywhere. </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Emancipation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individuals</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 8. Herein, developing the Path of Stream-Attainment (52), eradicating false 
views and doubts, and escaping from going to woeful states, one becomes a 
Stream-Winner who is born seven times at most. </p>

<p>Developing the Path of once-Returning (53), and attenuating lust, hatred, and 
ignorance, one becomes a Once-Returner, returning to this world only once. </p>

<p>Developing the path of Never-Returning (54), and totally eradicating sensual 
desires and hatred, one becomes a Never-Returner not returning to this 
(Sentient) state.</p>

<p>Developing the Path of the Worthy, and totally eradicating all defilements, 
one becomes a Worthy One (55), who is free from Corruptions, and who is fit to 
receive the highest offerings in this world. </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Individuals. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>49. <b>Attābhinivesa</b> - The stronghold of a soul like the doer of action, 
the reaper of fruit, &#39;this is my soul&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>50. <b>Vipallāsanimittam</b> - Three <i>vipallāsas</i> or misconceptions are 
discarded by meditating on &#39;impermanence&#39;. They are &#39;erroneous perception&#39; <i>
(saññā-vipallāsa),</i> &#39;erroneous ideas&#39; <i>(citta-vipallāsa),</i> and 
&#39;erroneous views&#39; <i>(ditthi-vipallāsa). </i>On account of these three 
misconceptions people regard what is impermanent as permanent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>51. <b>Tanhāpanidhi</b> - Such hankerings like &#39;this is mine&#39;, &#39;this is 
happiness&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52. <b>Sotāpanno</b> - One who has entered the stream that leads to Nibbāna 
for the first time. There are three classes of Sotāpannas, namely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. Those who will be born seven times at most in heavenly and earthly 
  realms <i>(sattakkhattuparama).</i> Before seeking an eighth birth, they 
  attain Arahatship. </p>
  <p>ii. Those who seek birth in noble families two or three times before they 
  attain Arahatship (kolamkola). </p><p>iii. Those who are born only once more before they attain Arahatship <i>
	(ekabījī). </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Sotāpanna has unshakable confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha. 
He neither violates the five precepts nor commits the heinous crimes. Free from 
birth in woeful states, he is ever destined for enlightenment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. Sakadāgāmi - One who returns to this world of human beings only once. 
After attaining Sakadāgāmi in this life, he may be born in a heavenly realm and 
attain Arahatship seeking birth in the human plane. </p>

<p>There are five kinds of Sakadāgāmis, namely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi here and attain Parinibbāna here 
		itself. </p>
        <p>ii. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi in a heavenly realm and attain 
		Parinibbāna there.</p>
        <p>iii. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi here and attain Parinibbāna in a 
		heavenly realm. </p>
        <p>iv. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi in a heavenly realm and attain 
		Parinibbāna in this human plane. </p>
        <p>v. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi here and, having being born in a 
		heavenly realm, seek birth in this human plane and attain Parinibbāna.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>54. <b>Anāgāmi</b> - one who will not return to this Sense sphere <i>
(kāmaloka).</i>
Such beings are born in the &#39;Pure Abodes&#39; <i>(suddhāvāsa),</i> higher Brahma 
realms where Anāgāmis abide till they attain Arahatship. </p>

<p>There are five classes of Anāgāmis: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Those who attain Parinibbāna within the first half life-span in 
		the Pure Abodes (antaraparinibbāyi). </p><p>ii. Those who attain Parinibbāna having lived more than half a 
		  life-span (upahaccaparinibbāyi).</p><p>iii. Those who attain Parinibbāna with exertion (sasankhāra 
		  parinibbāyi).</p><p>iv. Those who attain Parinibbāna without exertion (asasankhāra 
		  parinibbāyi).</p><p>v. Those who, passing beyond one Brahma realm to another higher 
		  Brahma realm, attain Parinibbāna in the Highest Brahma realm <i>
		  (uddhamsota akanitthagāmi).</i> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>55. <b>Khīnāsavo</b> - synonymous with an Arahat, a Worthy One, because he 
has destroyed all the defilements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Path of Purification</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the <i>jhānas</i> are developed, the mind is so purified, that it 
resembles a polished mirror, where everything is clearly reflected in true 
perspective. Still, there is not complete freedom from unwholesome thoughts, 
for, by concentration, the evil tendencies are only temporarily inhibited. They 
may rise to the surface at quite unexpected moments. </p>

<p>Discipline regulates words and deeds; concentration controls the mind; but it 
is Insight <i>(paññā)</i> the third and the final stage, that enables the 
aspirant to Sainthood to eradicate wholly the defilements inhibited by <i>
samādhi</i>. </p>

<p>At the outset he cultivates &#39;Purity of Vision&#39; <i>(ditthi visuddhi)</i>
(the third member of the Path of Purity) in order to see things as they truly 
are. With a one-pointed mind he analyses and examines this so-called being. This 
searching examination shows that what he has called &#39;I&#39;, is merely a complex 
compound of mind and matter which are in a state of constant flux. </p>

<p>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of this so-called being, 
freed from the false notion of a permanent soul, he searches for the causes of 
this &#39;I&#39; personality. He realizes that there is nothing in the world which is 
not conditioned by some cause or causes, past or present, and that his present 
existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>(tanhā),</i> 
attachment <i>(upādāna),</i> Kamma, and physical food of the present life. On 
account of these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and as past causes 
have conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. 
Meditating thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to past, present and 
future (<i>kankhāvitaranavisuddhi,</i> the fourth member of the Path of Purity). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thereupon he contemplates the truth that all conditioned things are transient <i>
(anicca), </i>subject to suffering <i>(dukkha),</i> and devoid of an immortal 
soul <i>(anattā).</i> Wherever he turns his eyes he sees naught but these three 
characteristics standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a flux 
conditioned by internal and external causes. Nowhere does he find any genuine 
happiness for everything is fleeting. </p>

<p>As he thus contemplates the real nature of life, and is absorbed in 
meditation a day comes, when, to his surprise, he witnesses an aura <i>(obhāsa)</i>
emitted by his body. He experiences an unprecedented pleasure happiness and 
quietude. He becomes even-minded, his religious fervour increases, mindfulness 
becomes clear and insight keen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress 
for Sainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking 
for this mental state. Soon the realization comes that these new developments 
are impediments to moral progress and he cultivates the purity of knowledge with 
regard to the Path and Non-Path (<i>maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi,</i>
the fifth member of the Path of Purity).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of all conditioned things. Of 
these two states the latter becomes more impressed on his mind since change is 
more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he directs his attention to 
contemplation of the dissolution of things
<i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He perceives that both mind and matter which constitute 
this so-called being are in a state of constant flux, not remaining the same for 
two consecutive moments. To him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving 
things are fearful <i>(bhaya ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a 
pit of burning embers, a source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the 
wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava ñāna) </i>of the fearful and deluded world, 
and develops a feeling of disgust <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i> followed by a strong 
will for deliverance from it <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p>With this object in view, he resumes his meditation on the three 
characteristics of transiency, sorrow, and soullessness <i>(patisankhā ñāna),</i> 
and thereafter develops complete equanimity towards all conditioned things, 
having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly object <i>(upekkhā 
ñāna).*</i> <a NAME="page429"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* These nine kinds of Insight - namely, <i>udaya, vaya, bhanga, bhaya, 
ādīnava, nibbidā, muñcitukamyatā, patisankhā, upekkhā ñānas</i> are collectively 
termed <i>patipadāñānadassanavisuddhi</i> and <i>anuloma</i> - Purity of Vision 
in discerning the method the sixth number of the Path of Purity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reaching this point of spiritual culture, he chooses one of the three 
characteristics for his object of special endeavour and intently cultivates 
Insight in that particular direction until the glorious day when he first 
realizes Nibbāna,* his ultimate goal. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Insight found in this supramundane Path Consciousness is known as <i>
nānadassana</i>
<i>visuddhi</i> - Purity of Vision regarding intuitive wisdom, the seventh 
member of the Path of Purity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;As the traveler by night sees the landscape around him by a flash of 
lightning, and the picture so obtained swims long thereafter before his dazzled 
eyes, so the individual seeker, by the flashing light of insight, glimpses 
Nibbāna with such clearness that the after-picture never more fades from his 
mind&quot;. (Dr. Paul Dahlke)</p>

<p>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time he is called a 
Sotāpanna (s<font SIZE="2">ee Chapter I)</font> - one who has entered the stream 
that leads to Nibbāna for the first time. </p>

<p>The Stream represents the noble Eightfold Path. </p>

<p>A Stream-Winner is no more a worldling (puthujjana), but an Ariya (Noble). </p>

<p>On attaining this first stage of Sainthood he eradicates the following three 
Fetters <i>(samyojana)</i> that bind him to existence, namely: </p>

  <p>1. <b>Sakkāya-ditthi</b> - <i>sati + kāye + ditthi,</i> literally, view 
  when a group exists. Here <i>kāya</i> refers to the five Aggregates of matter, 
  feeling, perception, mental states, and consciousness, or, in other words, to 
  the complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging 
  entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho physical 
  aggregates is termed <i>sakkāya-ditthi.</i>
  Dhammasangani enumerates twenty kinds of such soul theories (s<font SIZE="2">ee 
  Dhammasangani Translation, pp. 257-259)</font>. <i>Sakkāya-ditthi</i> is 
  usually rendered by self-illusion, theory of individuality, illusion of 
  individualism. </p>
  <p>2. <b>Vicikicchā</b> - Doubts. They are doubts about 1. the Buddha, 2. the 
  Dhamma, 3. the Sangha, 4. the disciplinary rules <i>(sikkhā), </i>5. the past, 
  6. the future, 7. both the past and the future, and 8. Dependent Arising <i>
  (paticca-samuppāda).</i>
  (see Dhammasangani Translation p. 239)</p><p>3. <b>Sīlabbataparāmāsa</b> - Adherence to (wrongful) rites and 
	ceremonies. </p>
  <p>Dhammasangani explains it thus: &quot;It is the theory held by ascetics an 
  Brahmins outside this doctrine, that purification is obtained by rules of 
  moral conduct, or by rites, or by both rules of moral conduct and rites&quot;. </p>

<p>For the eradication of the remaining seven Fetters a Sotāpanna is reborn 
seven times at most. He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and 
the Sangha. He would not for any reason violate any of the five precepts. He is 
not subject to states of woe as he is destined for Enlightenment. </p>

<p>With fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, the noble 
pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight, becomes a Sakadāgāmi - 
Once-Returner - reaching the second stage of Sainthood by attenuating two other 
Fetters, namely, sense-desires <i>(kāmāraga)</i> and ill will <i>(patigha).</i> </p>

<p>Now he is called a Once-Returner because he is born in the human realm only 
once, should he not attain Arahatship in that birth itself. It is interesting to 
note that the Ariya Saint who has attained the second stage of Sainthood can 
only weaken these two powerful Fetters with which he is bound from a 
beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he harbours thoughts of 
lust and anger. </p>

<p>It is by attaining the third State of Sainthood, that of the Anāgāmi 
(Never-Returner), that he completely eradicates these two Fetters. Thereafter he 
neither returns to this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, since he 
has rooted out the desire for sensual gratification. After death he is reborn in 
the Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsa), an environment exclusively reserved for Anāgāmis 
and Arahats. </p>

<p>A layman may become an Anāgāmi, provided he leads a celibate life. </p>

<p>The Anāgāmi Saint now makes his final advance and destroying the remaining 
five Fetters, namely, attachment to Realms of Form <i>(rūparāga)</i>
attachment to Formless Realms <i>(arūparāga),</i> pride <i>(māna), </i>
restlessness <i>(uddhacca),
</i>and ignorance <i>(avijjā), </i>attains Arahatship the final state of 
Sainthood. </p>

<p>Stream-Winners, Once-Returners, Never-Returners are called Sekhas because 
they have yet to undergo training. Arahats are called Asekhas because they no 
longer need any training. </p>

<p>An Arahat, literally, a Worthy One, is not subject to rebirth because he does 
not accomplish fresh Karmic activities, the seeds of his reproduction in matter 
have all been destroyed. </p>

<p>The Arahat realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done. A heavy 
burden of sorrow has finally been relinquished, and all forms of craving and all 
shades of ignorance are totally annihilated. The happy pilgrim now stands on 
heights more than celestial, far removed from uncontrolled passions and the 
defilements of the world. </p>

<p>Attainments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 9. Herein &#39;the Attainment to Fruition&#39; is common to all in accordance with 
their respective fruits. </p>

<p>But &#39;the Attainment to Cessation (56) is possible only to Never-Returners and 
Arahats. </p>

<p>In this case, one attains successively to the great ecstasies like the first <i>
jhāna,</i> etc., and emerging therefrom contemplates on the conditioned things 
in each of those <i>jhānas.</i> Thus he proceeds up to &#39;the State of 
Nothingness&#39;. Then, having attended to the preliminary duties such as resolving, 
etc., he attains to the state of Neither-Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;. Now 
after two ecstatic <i>javana</i>
thought-moments his stream of consciousness is suspended. Thereafter he attains 
to (Supreme) &#39;Cessation&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of rising, if to a Never-Returner, an Anāgāmi Fruit consciousness 
or to an Arahat, an Arahat Fruit consciousness, occurs only for a single moment 
and then lapses into <i>bhavanga.</i> This is followed by the knowledge of 
reflection. </p>

<p>Herein this is the Section on Attainments. </p>

<p>The end of exercises on mental culture or Insight. </p>

<p>One who wishes to enjoy the essence of practice in this Dispensation should 
thus develop the sublime dual meditation. </p>

<p>This is the ninth chapter of the Compendium of Abhidhamma which deals with 
the Exercise on Meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aspirations </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As invited by Namba, a person of refined manners, belonging to a respectable 
family, full of faith and replete with sterling virtues, to compose a treatise 
out of compassion for others, this book has been completed. </p>

<p>By this great merit may the modest monks, ho are purified by wisdom and who 
shine in discipline, remember till the end of the world the most famous 
Tumūlasoma Monastery, the abode of grain, for the acquisition of merit and for 
their happiness. </p>

<p>Thus ends the treatise called the Abhidhammattha Sangaha composed by the 
great teacher, Anuruddha.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>56. <b>Nirodhasamāpatti</b> - Lit., &#39;attainment to cessation&#39;. It is so 
called because during this period the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases 
to flow. Mind is suspended, but vitality persists. </p>

<p>It is only an Anāgāmi or an Arahat who has developed the <i>rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i> <i>jhānas</i> who can attain to this supreme state of ecstasy. </p>

<p>When such a person wishes to attain to <i>nirodhasamāpatti,</i> he first 
attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> and, emerging from it, he meditates on the 
transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of conditioned states found in that 
particular
<i>jhāna.</i> Likewise, he attains, in order, to the remaining <i>jhānas</i> and 
meditates in the same way until the <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of &#39;Nothingness&#39;.</p>

<p>Emerging from this <i>jhāna,</i> he makes the following four resolutions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(i) that his fourfold requisites be not destroyed, </p>
        <p>(ii) that he should arise in time when his services are needed by the 
		Sangha, </p>
        <p>(iii) that he should arise in time when he is summoned by the Buddha, </p>
        <p>(iv) whether he will live for more than seven days from that moment. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>He has to think of his age-limit as this ecstatic state normally extends to 
seven days. </p>

<p>After making these resolutions, he attains to the last <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of 
&#39;Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;, and remains in that state for two <i>
javana</i>
thought moments. Immediately after, he attains to <i>nirodha-samāpatti</i> when 
his stream of consciousness, is temporarily suspended. After seven days he 
emerges from this state and experiences for a single moment an Anāgāmi Phala 
consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat Phala consciousness in the 
case of an Arahat. Thereafter arises the <i>bhavanga citta. </i></p>
