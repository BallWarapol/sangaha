<p>CHAPTER VI - ANALYSIS OF MATTER</b></u></font></p>

<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p>[The first Edition comprised 2 Volumes. The first Volume contained Chapter I 
to V and the second Volume Chapter VI to IX.]</p>

<p>The first five chapters of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha deal with the 89 and 
121 types of consciousness, 52 mental states, various thought-processes in the 
course of one&#39;s lifetime and at rebirth, 31 planes of existence, and 
classification of Kamma. In one sense they form one complete book. </p>

<p>The remaining four chapters are devoted to </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p> <i>rūpa</i> (matter),
  </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Nibbāna, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>paticca-samuppāda</i> (the Law of Dependent Arising), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>patthāna naya</i> (Causal Relations), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Categories of Good and Evil, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Mental Culture, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Path of Purity, and </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>Great Attainments. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The sixth chapter is confined mainly to <i>rūpa</i> and Nibbāna.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight species of Rūpa are enumerated. What they are, how they arise, 
persist, and perish, are also explained. <i>Rūpa</i> is the third <i>paramattha</i>
mentioned in the Abhidhamma, and is one of the two composite factors of this 
so-called being - the other being <i>nāma</i> (mind). As <i>nāma,</i> so <i>rūpa</i> 
too has been microscopically analysed. But no logical definition of <i>rūpa</i> 
is found either in the Text or in the Commentaries. </p>

<p><i>Rūpa</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>rup, </i>to break 
up, to perish<i> (nāsa). </i></p>

<p>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā, <i>rūpa</i> is that which transforms or 
assumes a different mode owing to the adverse physical conditions of cold heat, 
etc. <i>(sītonhādi virodhippaccayehi vikāram āpajjati). </p>

<p></i>From a Buddhist standpoint <i>rūpa</i> not only changes but also perishes <i>
(khaya, vaya).</i> It endures only for seventeen thought-moments. <i>Rūpa</i>
changes so rapidly that one cannot strike an identical place twice. </p>

<p><i>Rūpa</i> is also explained as that which manifests itself <i>(<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> 
rup - pakāsane).</i> </p>

<p>Scholars suggest various renderings for <i>rūpa.</i> It is generally rendered 
by &#39;form&#39;, &#39;body&#39;, &#39;matter&#39;, &#39;corporeality&#39;, etc. meanings differ according to 
the context. One particular meaning is not universally applicable. </p>

<p>From a philosophical standpoint, &#39;matter&#39; is the nearest equivalent for
<i>rūpa,</i> although scientists too find it difficult to define matter. </p>

<p>It should be noted that the atomic theory prevailed in India in the time of 
the Buddha. <i>Paramānu</i> was the ancient term for the modern atom. According 
to the ancient belief one <i>ratharenu</i> consists of 36 <i>tajjāris;</i> one <i>
tajjāri,</i>
36 <i>anus;</i> one <i>anu,</i> 36 <i>paramānus.</i> The minute particles of 
dust seen dancing in the sunbeam are called <i>ratharenus.</i> One <i>paramānu</i> 
is therefore, 1/46, 656th part of a <i>ratharenu.</i> This <i>paramānu</i> was 
considered indivisible. </p>

<p>With His supernormal knowledge the Buddha analysed this so-called <i>paramānu</i>
and declared that it consists of <i>paramatthas</i> - ultimate entities which 
cannot further be subdivided. </p>

<p>The <i>paramatthas</i> are <i>pathavi, āpo, tejo,</i> and <i>vāyo.</i>
One must not understand that these elements are earth, water, fire and air, as 
some Greek thinkers believed in the past. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Pathavi</b> means the element of extension, the substratum of matter. 
Without it objects cannot occupy space. The qualities of hardness and softness 
which are purely relative are two conditions of this particular element. It may 
be stated that this element is present in earth, water, fire and air. For 
instance, the water above is supported by water below. It is this element of 
extension in conjunction with the element of motion, that produces the upward 
pressure. Heat or cold is the <i>tejo</i>
element, while fluidity is the <i>āpo</i> element </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>āpo</b> is the element of cohesion. Unlike pathavi it is intangible. It is 
this element that makes scattered particles of matter cohere, and gives rise to 
the idea of &#39;body&#39;. When solid bodies are melted, this element becomes more 
prominent in the resulting fluid. This element is found even in minute particles 
when solid bodies are reduced to powder. The elements of extension and cohesion 
are so closely interrelated that when cohesion ceases extension disappears. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Tejo</b> is the element of heat. Cold is also a form of <i>tejo.</i>
Both heat and cold are included in <i>tejo</i> because they possess the power of 
maturing bodies, Tejo, in other words, is the vitalizing energy. Preservation 
and decay are also due to this element. Unlike the other three essentials of 
matter, this element has the power to regenerate matter by itself. </p>

<p>Inseparably connected with heat is <b>vāyo,</b> the element of motion. 
Movements are caused by this element. Motion is regarded as the force or the 
generator of heat. &quot;Motion and heat in the material realm correspond 
respectively to consciousness and Kamma in the mental.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These four elements coexist and are inseparable, but one may preponderate 
over another as, for instance, <i>pathavi</i> in earth, <i>āpo</i> in water,
<i>tejo</i> in fire, and <i>vāyo</i> in air. </p>

<p>They are also called Mahābhūtas, or Great Essentials because they are 
invariably found in all material substances ranging from the infinitesimally 
small cell to the most massive object. </p>

<p>Dependent on them are the four subsidiary material qualities of colour <i>
(vanna),</i>
smell <i>(gandha),</i> taste <i>(rasa),</i> and nutritive essence <i>(ojā).</i> 
These eight coexisting forces and qualities constitute one material group called <i>
&#39;suddhatthaka rūpa kalāpa</i> - pure-octad material group&#39;. </p>

<p>The remaining twenty kinds of <i>rūpa</i> are equally important. </p>

<p>It should be noted that physical life-principle <i>(rūpa jīvitindriya)</i> 
and sex are also conditioned by Kamma. Life in inorganic matter should be 
differentiated from life in animate beings. </p>

<p>The fact that <i>rūpas</i> arise in four ways such as Kamma, mind, seasonal 
phenomena, and food, will be a novel idea to modern thinkers. All these four 
sources can, to a great extent, be brought under one&#39;s control. </p>

<p>To some extent we are responsible for the creation of our own material 
phenomena, desirable or undesirable. </p>

<p>The accumulated Karmic tendencies created by persons in the course of their 
previous lives, play at times a greater role than the hereditary parental cells 
and genes, in the formation of physical characteristics.</p>

<p>The Buddha, for instance, inherited like every other person, the reproductive 
cells and genes from His parents. But physically there was none comparable to 
Him in His long line of honorable ancestors. In the Buddha&#39;s own words, He 
belonged not to the royal lineage, but to that of the Aryan Buddhas. He was 
certainly a superman, an extraordinary creation of His own Kamma.</p>

<p>According to the Lakkhana Sutta (D. 30) the Buddha inherited these 
exceptional features, such as the 32 major marks, as the result of his past 
meritorious deeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical feature is 
clearly explained in the Sutta. </p>

<p>In the sixth chapter only a few lines are devoted to the fourth <i>paramattha</i>
- Nibbāna - the <i>summum bonum</i> of Buddhism. But the path to Nibbāna is 
described in detail in the ninth chapter. </p>

<p>The seventh chapter enumerates all ethical states and classifies them into 
various groups. </p>

<p>The two most profound philosophical teachings of Buddhism - namely, the Law 
of Dependent Arising <i>(paticca-samuppāda)</i> and the twenty-four Causal 
Relations<i>
(Patthāna) </i>are described in the eighth chapter. </p>

<p>The last chapter is the most important and the most interesting, as it deals 
with Mental Culture <i>(bhāvanā)</i> and Emancipation, the quintessence of 
Buddhism. </p>

<p>To understand the intricacies of Abhidhamma one should critically read and 
reread the Abhidhammattha Sangaha patiently and carefully, pondering at the same 
time on the profound teachings embodied therein. </p>

<p>One who understands the Abhidhamma well can fully comprehend the Word of the 
Buddha and thereby realize one&#39;s ultimate goal. </p>

<p>Analysis of Matter</b></font></p>

<b>

<p>Introductory</b></p>

<p>§ 1. Having thus far described the consciousness and mental states in 
accordance with their classes (1) and processes (2), matter will now be dealt 
with. </p>

<p>With respect to enumeration (3), divisions (4), arising (5), groups (6), and 
the mode of happening (7), the compendium of matter therein is fivefold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Enumeration of matter <i>(samuddesa)</i></b></p>

<p>§ 2. Matter is twofold-namely, the four Great Essentials (8), and material 
qualities derived from them (9). These two constitute eleven species. </p>

<p>How? </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(1) Essential material qualities - the element of extension (10), the 
  element of cohesion (11), the element of heat (12), and the element of motion 
  (13). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(2) Sensitive material qualities (14) viz: eye, ear, nose, tongue, and 
  body. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(3) Material objects (15), viz: form (16), sound, odour, taste, and 
  tangibility (17) - found in the three Essentials excluding the element of 
  cohesion. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(4) Material qualities of sex (18), viz: femininity and masculinity. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(5) Material quality of base, viz: the heart-base (19). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(6) Material quality of life, viz: vital principle (20), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(7) Material quality of nutrition, viz: edible food (21). </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus these eighteen (22) kinds of material qualities are grouped: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(i) according to their innate characteristics (23), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(ii) according to their respective marks (24). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(iii) as conditioned (25),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(iv) as changeable (26),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(v) as (fit for) contemplation (27). </p>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>(8) Limiting material quality, viz: the element of space (28). </p>
  <p>(9) Communicating material quality (29) - viz: - bodily intimation and 
  vocal intimation. </p>
  <p>(10) Mutable material qualities (30) - viz: - material lightness (31), 
  softness (32), adaptability (33), and the two forms of intimation. </p>
  <p>(11) Characteristics (34) of material qualities, viz: material 
  productivity, continuity, decay and impermanence. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here by productivity and continuity are meant the material quality of 
	birth.</p>
    <p>Thus the eleven kinds of material qualities are treated as twenty eight 
	according to their intrinsic properties. </p>
  </blockquote>

<p>How (twenty-eight)? </p>

<p>Essentials, sensory organs, objects, sex, heart, vitality, and food thus 
(matter) is eighteen fold. </p>

<p>Limitation (space), intimation, change-ability, and characteristics - thus 
there are ten non-conditioned (by kamma ). In all there are twenty-eight. </p>

<p>Herein this is the enumeration of matter. </p>

<a name='3-2' href='?#3-2'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>1. The first three chapters dealt with different types of consciousness and 
mental states, both concisely and descriptively. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. The fourth chapter was confined to 7 thought-processes during lifetime, 
and the fifth chapter, to various planes and processes of rebirth consciousness.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Samuddesa</b> - i.e., the brief exposition of <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Vibhāga</b> - i.e., the analysis of <i>rūpa.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Samutthāna</b> - i.e., the arising of different constituents of <i>rūpa</i>
such as eye-decad, etc., caused by Kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and food. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Kalāpa</b> - the group compositions of rūpa, such as body-decad, 
sex-decad. etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Pavattikkama</b> - i.e., how <i>rūpas</i> take place in accordance with 
the states of existence, time, and classes of beings. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Mahābhūtāni</b> - lit ., those that have grown great. The four Great 
Essentials are the fundamental material elements which are inseparable. Every 
material substance, ranging from the minutest particle to the most massive 
object, consists of these four elements which possess specific characteristics. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Upādāya-rūpāni</b> - Derivative or secondary material properties 
dependent on the Great Essentials. Like the earth are the Essentials; the 
Derivatives are like trees that spring therefrom. The remaining 24 <i>rūpas</i> 
are regarded as Derivatives. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Pathavi-dhātu</b> - The Pāli term <i>dhātu</i> means that which bears 
its own characteristic marks. Element is the closest equivalent for <i>dhātu. 
Pathavi dhātu,</i> literally, means the earth-element. It is so called because 
like the earth it serves as a support or foundation for the other coexisting <i>
rūpas.</i> <i>Pathavi</i>
(Sanskrit: <i>prthivi),</i> also spelt <i>pathavi, puthavi, puthuvi, puthuvi</i> 
- is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>puth, </i>to expand, to 
extend. So far, though not very satisfactory, the closest equivalent for <i>
pathavi-dhātu</i> is &#39;the element of extension&#39;. Without it objects cannot 
occupy space. Both hardness and softness are characteristics of this element. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>āpo-dhātu</b> - lit., the fluid element . āpo is derived from
<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ap,</i> to arrive, or from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font>
pāy, </i>to grow, to increase. It is &#39;the element of cohesion . According to 
Buddhism it is this element that makes different particles of matter cohere, and 
thus prevents them from being scattered about. Both fluidity and contraction are 
the properties of this element. It should be understood that cold is not a 
characteristic of this element. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Tejo-dhātu</b> - lit., the fire-element, is explained as &#39;the element 
of heat&#39;. <i>Tejo</i> is derived from<i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> tij,</i> 
to sharpen, to mature. Vivacity and maturity are due to the presence of this 
element. Both heat and cold are the properties of <i>tejo.</i> Intense <i>tejo</i> 
is heat, and mild <i>tejo</i>
is cold. It should not be understood that cold is the characteristic of <i>āpo</i> 
and heat is that of <i>tejo;</i> for, in that case, both heat and cold should be 
found together, as <i>āpo</i> and <i>tejo</i> coexist. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Vāyo-dhātu</b> - lit., &#39;the air-element&#39;, is explained as the element 
of motion. <i>Vāyo</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vay,</i>
to move, to vibrate. Motion, vibration, oscillation, and pressure are caused by 
this element. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Pasāda-rūpa</b> - They are the sensitive parts of the five organs - 
eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. They tend to clarify the coexisting material 
qualities. The perceptible physical eye, for instance, is the <i>sasambhāra 
cakkhu</i> or composite eye, which consists of the four <i>bhūta-rūpas,</i> four <i>
upādā-rūpas</i>
(colour, odour, taste, and sap), and <i>jīvitindriya</i> (vitality). The 
sensitive part which lies at the center of the retina and which enables one to 
see objects is, the <i>cakkhu pasāda.</i> This is the basis of the 
eye-consciousness <i>(cakkhu-viññāna)</i> and becomes the instrument for the 
eye-door thought-process <i>(cakkhu-dvāravīthi).</i> The desire to see tends to 
develop the sense of sight. The eye, therefore, consists of ten material 
qualities of which <i>pasāda</i> is one.</p>

<p>The other <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> should be similarly understood. </p>

<p>The <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> of ear, nose, and tongue are in their respective 
centers; the <i>kāya-pasāda-rūpa</i> is diffused throughout the body except on 
hair, on the tips of nails, and in withered skin. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Gocararūpa</b> - The sense-fields which serve as supports for the 
sense-cognitions to arise. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Rūpa</b> - Both colour and shape are implied by this term. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Photthabba</b> - owing to its subtlety, the element of cohesion <i>
(āpo)</i>
cannot be felt by the sense of touch. Only the other three Fundamental Elements 
are regarded as tangible. In water, for instance, the cold felt is <i>tejo,</i> 
the softness is <i>pathavi,</i> and the pressure is <i>vāyo.</i> One cannot 
touch <i>āpo</i> as its property is cohesion. </p>

<p>See Compendium, p. 155, n. 6. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Itthattam purisattam</b> - also termed <i>itthindriyam, purisindriyam </i>
- are collectively called in the abbreviated form <i>bhāva-rūpa,</i>
the state by means of which masculinity and femininity are distinguished. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>Hadayavatthu</b> - The seat of consciousness. Dhammasangani omits this <i>
rūpa.</i> In the Atthasālini <i>hadayavatthu</i> is explained as <i>cittassa 
vatthu</i> (basis of consciousness). </p>

<p>It is clear that the Buddha did not definitely assign a specific seat for 
consciousness, as He has done with the other senses. It was the cardiac theory 
(the view that heart is the seat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, 
and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have 
accepted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Patthāna, 
the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such 
indirect terms as <i>&quot;yam rūpam nissāya&#39;&#39;</i>
&quot;depending on that material thing&quot;, without positively asserting whether that <i>
rūpa</i>
was either the heart <i>(hadaya)</i> or the brain. But, according to the views 
of commentators like Venerable Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha, the seat of 
consciousness is definitely the heart. It should be understood that the Buddha 
has neither accepted nor rejected this ancient popular cardiac theory. </p>

<p>See Compendium p. 156, n. 1, and p. 277. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Jīvitindriya</b> - There is vitality both in mind and in matter. 
Psychic life, which is one of the fifty-two mental states <i>(cetasikās),</i> 
and physical life, which is one of the twenty-eight <i>rūpas,</i> are essential 
characteristics of this so-called being. Psychic life is one of the seven 
universals and physical life is associated with almost every material group 
except in dead matter. Simultaneous with the arising of the 
rebirth-consciousness, physical life also springs up together with the initial 
material groups. <i>Jīvita</i> is qualified by <i>indriya</i>
because it has a dominating influence over other co-adjuncts in vivifying them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>Kabalīkāro āhāro</b> - so called because gross food is taken in by 
making into morsels. Here <i>āhāra</i> means nutritive essence <i>(ojā) </i>
which sustains the physical body. In the statement - <i>sabbe sattā 
āhāratthitikā,</i> all beings live on food - <i>āhāra</i> means a condition <i>
(paccaya). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. Eighteen - 5+4 (tangibility excluded), 2+1+1+1 = 18. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Sabhāva-rūpa</b> - With respect to their own peculiar characteristics 
such as hardness, fluidity, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Salakkhanarūpa</b> - So called because they arise with the inherent 
general marks of impermanence <i>(anicca), </i>suffering <i>(dukkha) </i>and 
soullessness <i>(anattā). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Nipphannarūpa</b> - i.e., produced by Kamma mind, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Rūparūpa</b> - Here the first term <i>rūpa</i> is used in its 
etymological sense, i.e., change-ableness, as in the Pāli phrase - <i>
dukkha-dukkha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Sammasanarūpa</b> - Because it enables one to employ them as objects 
fit for contemplation or insight. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>ākāsadhātu</b> - Ceylon Commentators derive <i>ākāsa</i>
from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> kas,</i> to plough. Since there is no 
ploughing as on earth, space is called <i>ākāsa</i>. According to Sanskrit, <i>
ākāsa</i> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> kās, </i>to view, 
to recognize. In Ledi Sayadaw&#39;s opinion it is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> kās, </i>to shine, to appear. <i>ākāsa</i> is space which in itself is 
nothingness. As such it is eternal. <i>ākāsa</i> is a dhātu in the sense of a 
non-entity <i>(nijjīva),</i> not as an existing element like the four 
Essentials. By <i>ākāsa,</i> as one of the 28 <i>rūpas,</i>
is meant not so much the outside space as the intra-atomic space that &#39;limits&#39; 
or separates material groups <i>(rūpakalāpas).</i> Hence in Abhidhamma it is 
regarded as a <i>&#39;pariccheda-rūpa&#39;.</i>
Although <i>ākāsa</i> is not an objective reality, as it is invariably 
associated with all material units that arise in four ways, Abhidhamma teaches 
that it, too, is produced by the same four causes such as Kamma, mind, seasonal 
changes. and food. Simultaneous with the arising and perishing of the 
conditioned <i>rūpas, ākāsa rūpa</i> also arises and perishes. </p>

<p>See Compendium p. 226. </p>

<p>29. <b>Viññatti</b> is that by means of which one communicates one&#39;s ideas to 
another and one understands another&#39;s intentions. It is done both by action and 
speech - <i>kāya-viññatti</i> and <i>vacī-viññatti.</i> The former is caused by 
the &#39;air-element&#39; <i>(vāyo-dhātu) </i>produced by mind <i>(cittaja);</i> the 
latter by the &#39;earth-element produced by the mind. The duration of <i>viññatti</i> 
is only one thought-moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Vikārarūpa</b> - Change-ability of <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Lahutā</b> denotes physical health, and is comparable to an iron rod 
heated throughout the day. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Mudutā</b> is comparable to a well-beaten hide. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Kammaññatā</b> is opposed to the stiffness of the body, and is 
comparable to well-hammered gold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Lakkhanarūpa</b> - So called because they assume distinguishable 
characteristics at different stages, such as arising <i>(upāda),</i>
static <i>(thiti)</i> and dissolution <i>(bhanga).</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Upacaya</b> means the first heaping-up or the first arising. Here <i>&#39;upa&#39;</i>
is used in the sense of first. The arising of the first three decads - <i>kāya, 
bhāva,</i>
and <i>vatthu</i> - at the very moment of conception, is regarded as <i>upacaya.</i> 
The subsequent arising of the three decads from the static stage of 
rebirth-consciousness throughout lifetime is regarded as <i>santati.</i> Both <i>
upacaya</i> and <i>santati</i>
are sometimes treated as <i>jāti</i> - birth. Then the number of <i>rūpas</i> 
amounts to 27 instead of 28. </p>

<p>The life term of conditioned <i>rūpa</i> is normally 17 thought-moments or 51 
minor thought-instants (according to Commentators, during<font SIZE="2"> </font>
the time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments arise.)</p>

<p>The first thought-moment is like the <i>upacaya</i>, the last thought-moment 
is like the <i>aniccatā,</i> the intermediate 15 are like the <i>jaratā. 
Aniccatā</i> is the dissolution of <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, there are only three <i>lakkhanarūpas,</i> viz: birth, 
growth-decay, and death. <i>Aniccatā</i> is synonymous with <i>marana</i> 
(death). The entire interval between birth and death constitutes development or 
decay. </p>

<p>With the exception of the five <i>rūpas</i> - namely, two <i>viññattis, jāti, 
jarā,</i> and <i>aniccatā</i> - all the remaining 23 rūpas last for 17 
thought-moments. </p>

<p>Classification of Matter</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. Now all this matter divides itself into various categories as follows: </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>1. Rootless (35)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>2. Causal (36)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>3. With Defilements (37)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>4. Conditioned (38)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>5. Mundane (39)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>6. Pertaining to the Kāma-Sphere (40)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>7. Objectless (41)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>8. Not to be eradicated (42)</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matter is thus one-fold. When conceived as personal, external, and so forth, 
matter becomes manifold. </p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>The five kinds of sensitive material qualities are personal (43); the rest 
are external. </p>

<p>The six kinds, comprising the sensitives and the heart, are material 
qualities with basis (44); the rest are without a basis. </p>

<p>The seven kinds, comprising the sensitives and (the two) media of 
communication, are material qualities with a door (45); the rest are without 
doors. </p>

<p>The eight kinds, comprising the sensitives, sex-states, and vitality, are 
material qualities with a controlling faculty (46); the rest are without a 
controlling faculty. </p>

<p>The twelve kinds, comprising the sensitives and (seven) sense-objects 
(because &quot;tangibility&quot; comprises the three elements, excluding <i>āpo)</i>, are 
gross (47), proximate, and impinging material qualities; the rest are subtle, 
distant, and non-impinging. </p>

<p>Material qualities born of Kamma are &#39;grasped at&#39; (48); the others are &#39;not 
grasped at&#39;. </p>

<p>Object of form is visible; the rest are invisible. </p>

<p>Eye and ear, as not reaching (the object), and nose, tongue and body, as 
reaching (the object), are five kinds of material phenomena that take objects 
(49); the others do not. </p>

<p>Colour, odour, taste, sap (50), and the four Essentials are the eight kinds 
(51) of material phenomena that are inseparable; the rest are separable. </p>

<p><b></p>

<p>Summary</b></p>

<p>Thus the wise analyze, accordingly, the 28 kinds with respect to &#39;personal&#39; 
and so forth. </p>

<p>Herein this is the analysis of Matter. </p>

<a name='3-5' href='?#3-5'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>35. <b>Ahetukam</b> - Because they are not associated with the roots <i>
lobha, dosa,</i> etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Sappaccayam</b> - Because they are related to the causes - Kamma. <i>
citta, utu,</i> and <i>āhāra.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Sāsavam</b> - Since they serve as objects for Defilements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Sankhatam</b> - Because they are conditioned by the four causes - 
Kamma, <i>citta,</i> etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Lokiyam</b> - Because they are connected with the world of the Five 
Aggregates of Attachment <i>(pañcupādānakkhandhaloka). </i>There is no 
supramundane <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Kāmāvacaram</b> - Because they come within the range of sensual 
objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Anārammanam</b> - As they themselves do not perceive objects. It is 
the mind that perceives objects through the senses. Rūpas serve as 
sense-objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <b>Appahātābbam</b> - Because there is no gradual eradication of matter 
like passions. &#39;Indestructibility&#39; of matter is not implied by this term. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. <b>Ajjhattikam</b> - Belonging to the so-called self. The five sensitive 
organs are essential for living beings. Without them they are inanimate logs. 
They serve as doors to the mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. i.e., they serve as seats of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. They serve as doors to moral and immoral actions, mind and mental states, 
deeds and speech. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. They are so called because they possess a controlling power in their 
respective spheres. The physical eye, for instance, is composed of ten material 
qualities; but it is the sensitive eye <i>(cakkhupasādarūpa) </i>that controls 
the remaining nine. The remaining <i>pasādarūpas</i> should be similarly 
understood. The state of sex controls masculinity and femininity. Like the 
captain of a ship it is vitality that controls <i>rūpas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. <b>Olārikam</b> - Because of their importance both subjectively and 
objectively. They are regarded as <i>santike</i> (near) because of their 
receptivity. Owing to the grossness and nearness both sensitive organs and 
sense-objects mutually strike each other. Hence they are called <i>sappatigha,</i> 
lit., &#39;with striking against&#39;.</p>

<p>See Compendium p. 159, n. 4. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>48. <b>Upādinnam</b> - The first 18 kinds of <i>rūpa</i> born of Kamma are 
grasped by craving and false view. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>49. <b>Gocaraggāhikarūpam</b> - They are so called because they take external 
objects as pasture. According to the Abhidhammattha Sangaha, sight and sound are 
regarded as objects that do not approach the eye and ear respectively as in the 
case of bodily contacts, etc. Both eye and ear cognize distant objects without 
any direct approach. In the case of other objects they directly contact the 
sense-organs. For instance, taste must directly touch the tongue. So are the 
other two objects. This may be the reason, irrespective of the wave theory, why 
the author distinguishes between senses that reach, and do not reach, the 
objects. </p>

<p>See Compendium, p. 160. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>50. <b>Ojā,</b> as a <i>rūpa</i> in itself, has the power of producing other <i>
rūpas</i> as well. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>51. As a rule these eight <i>rūpas</i> are bound together. The four 
Essentials are inseparable and so are the four Derivatives. Hence they are also 
termed <i>&#39;suddhatthaka&#39;</i>
(&#39;pure octad&#39;) and <i>&#39;ojatthaka&#39;</i> (&#39;with ojā as the eighth&#39;). The growth of 
inanimate matter is also due to the presence of this universal <i>ojā</i>. </p>

<p>The Arising of Material Phenomena (52)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. Material phenomena arise in four ways, viz:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>1. Kamma, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>2. Mind, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>3. Seasonal Conditions, and </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>4. Food.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Material Phenomena arising from Kamma (53) </b></p>

<p>Therein, the twenty-five types of moral and immoral Kamma, pertaining to the <i>
kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i> Spheres, produce ,in one&#39;s own continuity, duly 
constituted material phenomena born of Kamma, at every moment, commencing from 
conception.
</p>

<p><b></p>

<p>2. Material Phenomena arising from Mind (54) </b></p>

<p>The seventy-five types of consciousness, excluding the Formless Resultants 
and the twice fivefold cognitives, produce mind-born material phenomena, from 
the first moment of life-continuum just as it arises. </p>

<p>Therein the ecstatic <i>javanas</i> regulate the bodily postures. But the 
Determining Consciousness, <i>javanas</i> of the <i>kāma</i> Sphere, and 
Super-knowledge Consciousness, produce also (bodily and vocal) media of 
communication. Herein the thirteen pleasurable <i>javanas</i> produce laughter 
too. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>

<p>3. Material Phenomena arising from Seasonal Conditions (55) </b></p>

<p>The <i>tejo</i>-element, which comprises both cold and heat, on reaching its 
static stage, produces, according to circumstances, both internal and external 
material phenomena, resulting from seasonal conditions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>

<p>4. Material Phenomena arising from Food (56) </b></p>

<p>Food, known as nutritive essence, during assimilation on reaching its static 
stage, produces material phenomena resulting from food.</p>

<p>Therein the heart and the (eight) material Faculties are born of Kamma. The 
two media of communication are born only of mind. Sound is born of mind and 
seasonal conditions. The triple qualities of lightness and so forth arise from 
seasonal conditions, mind, and food. The inseparable material qualities and the 
element of space arise from four causes. Characteristic material qualities do 
not arise from any cause. </p>

<p>Eighteen, fifteen, thirteen, and twelve arise respectively from Kamma, mind, 
seasonal conditions, and food. </p>

<p>The characteristic marks of matter that arise and so forth are not produced 
by any cause, they say, since they are wholly intrinsic. </p>

<a name='3-8' href='?#3-8'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>52. <b>Rhūpasamutthana</b> - Buddhism does not attempt to solve the problem 
of the ultimate origin of matter. It takes for granted that matter exists and 
states that <i>rūpa</i> develops in four ways. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. <b>Kammaja</b> - Strictly speaking, by Kamma are meant past moral and 
immoral types of consciousness. It is only those classes of consciousness 
pertaining to the <i>kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i>-spheres that tend to produce <i>
rūpa.</i> They are 12 types of immoral consciousness, 8 types of moral 
consciousness, and the 5 moral <i>rūpa jhānas.</i> A moral or immoral 
birth-reproductive Kamma generated at the dying moment of a person, conditions 
the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta)</i> in a subsequent birth. 
Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth-consciousness, <i>rūpas</i>
conditioned by past Kamma spring up at every instant, like the flame of a lamp, 
up to the 17th thought-moment reckoned from the dying moment of the person. </p>

<p>At the very moment of conception there arise, as a result of the reproductive 
Karmic force, three <i>dasakas</i> or &#39;decads&#39; - namely, the <i>kāya, bhāva,</i> 
and <i>vatthu</i> - body, sex, and base decads. The body decad is composed of 
the four elements, four derivatives, vitality and the <i>kāyapasāda.</i> The 
sex-decad and the base-decad are similarly constituted. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>54. <b>Cittaja</b> - Mind, the invisible but more powerful composite factor 
of the so-called being, has the potentiality to produce <i>rūpa.</i> In other 
words, good and bad thoughts produce desirable and undesirable material 
phenomena. This is apparent from the physical changes that result from thoughts 
generated by a person. According to Abhidhamma, it is from the arising moment of 
the first <i>bhavanga,</i> that is, immediately after the rebirth-consciousness, 
that material phenomena arising from mind spring up. The rebirth-consciousness 
does not produce mind-born <i>rūpas,</i> since Kamma does that function, and 
since it is a newcomer to the fresh existence. No mind-born <i>rūpas</i>
arise at the static and perishing thought-moments, as they are weak. The ten 
sense-cognitives lack the potentiality to produce <i>rūpa.</i> The four <i>arūpa 
vipāka</i>
<i>jhānas</i> do not produce <i>rūpa,</i> as they are developed through 
non-attachment to <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>It is stated that <i>jhāna</i> factors are essential to produce mind-born <i>
rūpa.</i> One who possesses <i>jhānas</i> can therefore produce powerful <i>
rūpas</i>
which would enable him to live even without edible food. The mentally alert do 
not lack vitality. One who experiences Nibbānic bliss could live without any 
food for a considerable period. For instance, the Buddha fasted 49 days 
immediately after His Enlightenment. </p>

<p>Of the 75 types of consciousness, 26 <i>javanas</i> (10 <i>rūpa kusala</i>
and <i>kriyā,</i> 8 <i>arūpa kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> and 8 <i>lokuttaras)</i> 
could produce abnormal bodily movements such as passing through the air, diving 
into the earth, walking on water, etc. </p>

<p>Here the Determining consciousness is the mind-door consciousness <i>
(manodvārāvajjana).</i>
29 <i>kāma-javanas</i> are the 12 <i>akusalas,</i> 1 <i>hasituppāda,</i> and 16 <i>
sobhana kusala</i> and <i>kriyā;</i> and <i>abhiññā cittas</i> are the two fifth <i>
jhāna kusala</i> and <i>kriyā,</i> accompanied by equanimity and connected with 
knowledge. </p>

<p>13 pleasurable <i>javanas</i> are the 4 <i>akusalas</i> and 8 <i>sobhana 
kusalas</i> and <i>kriyās,</i> accompanied by pleasure, and one <i>hasituppāda.</i> </p>

<p>Worldlings, when laughing or smiling, experience the four <i>akusalas</i>
and four <i>sobhanas;</i> Sekhas, the same types of consciousness excluding the 
two <i>akusalas</i>
accompanied by misbelief; Arahats, the four <i>kriyās</i> and one <i>
hasituppāda.</i>
The Buddhas smile only with the four <i>sobhana kriyās.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>55. <b>Utuja</b> - It was stated earlier that Kamma produces, at the moment 
of rebirth, three decads <i>kāya, bhāva,</i> and <i>vatthu.</i> The internal <i>
tejo</i>
element, found in these three groups, combined with the external <i>tejo</i> 
element, produces material phenomena caused by seasonal conditions at the static 
stage of the rebirth-consciousness. At the genetic stage Kamma-born <i>tejo</i> 
element takes the place of mind-born <i>tejo</i> element. </p>

<p>It is clear that the term <i>utu</i> has been used in the sense of <i>tejo</i>
which constitutes both heat and cold. Strictly speaking, it is the internal and 
external <i>tejo</i>
elements which produce <i>rūpa.</i> It should be understood that <i>rūpas</i> 
produced by climatic conditions are also included in the <i>utuja</i> class. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>56. <b>āharaja</b> - By āhāra are meant the nutritive essence present in 
physical food and the sap <i>(ojā)</i> contained in the material groups born of 
Kamma, mind, and seasonal conditions. The internal <i>ojā,</i> supported by the 
external nutritive essence, produces <i>rūpa</i> at the static stage which 
endures for 49 minor thought-instants. <i>Rūpas</i> arise when the <i>ojā</i> 
diffuses the body. Internal sap is alone incapable of producing <i>rūpa</i> 
without the aid of external nutritive essence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Hadaya</b> and 8 <i>indriya rūpas</i> (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, 
masculinity, feminity, and vitality) are wholly produced by Kamma. Thus <i>
jīvitindriya</i>
or the life-principle present in animate beings such as men and animals should 
be differentiated from the inanimate life of plants and inorganic substances as 
they are not the inevitable results of Kamma. </p>

<p>They do possess a certain kind of life different from human beings and 
animals. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>ākāsa</b> - It is interesting to note that this inter-atomic space is 
caused by all the four causes. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Sadda</b> - Articulate sounds are caused by mind; inarticulate sounds are 
caused by <i>utu.</i> Musical notes caused by men are produced by <i>utu,</i>
conditioned by mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Kammaja</b> = 18. They are: 8 inseparables + 1 Space + 1 Heart + 8 
Controlling faculties . </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Cittaja</b> = 15. They are: 5 Mutables + 1 Sound + 8 Inseparables + 1 
Space. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Utuja</b> = 13. They are: 1 Sound + Lightness, etc. 3 + 8 Inseparables + 1 
Space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>āhāraja</b> = 12. They are: Lightness, etc. 3 + 8 Inseparables + 1 Space . 
The four <i>lakkhana rūpas</i> are common to all as there is no <i>rūpa</i>
devoid of the three instants birth, decay, and death. </p>

<p>Grouping of Material Qualities (57)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 5. There are twenty-one material groups inasmuch as they arise together (or 
have a common genesis), cease together (or have a common cessation), have a 
common dependence, and coexist. </p>

<p>Therein vitality and the (eight) inseparable material qualities together with 
the eye are called the &#39;eye-decad&#39;. Similarly the &#39;ear-decad&#39; together with the 
ear and so forth, &#39;nose-decad&#39;, &#39;tongue-decad&#39;, &#39;body-decad&#39;, &#39;female-decad&#39;, 
&#39;male-decad&#39;, &#39;base-decad&#39;, should respectively be formed. Inseparably material 
qualities, together with vitality, are called the &#39;vital nonad&#39;. These nine 
groups are produced by Kamma. </p>

<p>The inseparable material qualities constitute the &#39;pure octad&#39;. They, 
together with the bodily intimation, constitute the &#39;bodily intimation nonad&#39;; 
together with the vocal intimation and sound, the &#39;vocal intimation decad&#39;; 
together with the material qualities of lightness, pliancy, and adaptability, 
the &#39;un-decad of lightness&#39; and so forth; the dodecad of bodily intimation, 
lightness, pliancy, and adaptability; and the tridecad of vocal intimation, 
sound, lightness, pliancy, and adaptability. </p>

<p>These six material groups are produced by mind. </p>

<p>The pure octad, the sound-nonad, the un-decad of lightness, pliancy, and 
adaptability; the dodecad of sound, lightness, pliancy, and adaptability-these 
four are produced by seasonal phenomena. </p>

<p>The pure octad, and the un-decad of lightness, pliancy and adaptability are 
the two material qualities produced by food. </p>

<p>Of them the two material groups produced by seasonal phenomena - pure octad 
and the sound, nonad - are found externally too. All the rest are strictly 
internal.
</p>

<p>There are twenty-one material groups - nine, six, four and two produced in 
due order from Kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and food. </p>

<p>As space demarcates, and characteristic marks just indicate, the wise state 
that they are not parts of material groups. </p>

<p>Herein this is the formation of material groups. </p>

<p>Arising of Material Phenomena (58)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 6. All these material qualities are obtained, with no deficiency, according 
to circumstances, during lifetime in the <i>kāma</i>-sphere. But at conception, 
to moisture-born beings and to those of spontaneous birth, there arise at most 
the seven decads - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, sex and base. As a minimum 
sometimes, eye, ear, nose, and sex decads are not obtained. This is how 
deficiencies of material groups should be understood. </p>

<p>To the womb-born creatures there arise three decads - body, sex and base. 
Sometimes, however, the sex-decad is not obtained. From the conception and 
thereafter, during lifetime, gradually there arise eye-decads and so forth. </p>

<p>Thus the continuity of material groups produced in four ways - namely, 
Kamma-born from the time of conception, mind-born from the second moment of 
consciousness, season-born from the time of the static stage, food-born from the 
time of the diffusion of nutritive essence - uninterruptedly flows on in the <i>
kāma</i>-sphere till the end of life, like the flame of a lamp, or the stream of 
a river. </p>

<p>But at the time of death, from the seventeenth moment, reckoned backward from 
the decease-consciousness starting from the static stage of consciousness, 
kamma-born material phenomena no longer arise. Kamma-born material qualities 
that arose earlier exist till the decease-moment and then cease. Following that, 
the consciousness-born and nutriment-born material phenomena come to cessation. 
Thereafter a continuity of material qualities produced by physical changes 
persists while what is called a corpse lasts. </p>

<p>Thus to the dead persons, again in a subsequent life, material qualities 
similarly arise starting from the conception. </p>

<p>In the <i>rūpa</i>-plane decads of nose, tongue, body, sex and the material 
groups produced by food do not arise. Therefore to them at the time of rebirth 
there arise four material groups produced by Kamma, such as the three decads of 
eye, ear, and base, and the vital nonad. During life material qualities produced 
by mind and physical changes arise. </p>

<p>But to the mindless beings there do not arise eye, ear, base and sound. 
Similarly mind-born material qualities do not arise. Therefore at the moment of 
their rebirth only the vital nonad arises. During lifetime material qualities 
produced by physical changes, with the exception of sound, continue. </p>

<p>Thus in the three planes of <i>kāma, rūpa</i> and <i>asañña</i>
(Mindless) the procedure of material phenomena should be understood in two ways 
as regards rebirth and lifetime. </p>

<p>In the <i>kāma</i>-sphere are obtained 28 material qualities, 23 in the <i>
rūpa</i>-plane, 17 in the <i>asañña</i>-plane, but none in the <i>arūpa</i>-plane.
</p>

<p>At the moment of birth, sound, mutation, decay and impermanence are not 
obtained. During lifetime there is nothing that is not obtained. </p>

<p>Herein this is the way how material qualities arise.</p>

<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nibbāna (59)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 7. Nibbāna however is termed supramundane, and is to be realized by the 
wisdom of the Four Paths. It becomes an object to the Paths and Fruits, and is 
called Nibbāna because it is a departure <i>(ni)</i> from cord-like, <i>(vāna</i>) 
craving. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is onefold according to its intrinsic nature. </p>

<p>According to the way (it is experienced) it is twofold - namely, the element 
of Nibbāna with the substrata remaining, and the element of Nibbāna without the 
substrata remaining. </p>

<p>It is threefold according to its different aspects, namely, Void (60), 
Signless (61), and Longing-free (62). </p>

<p>Great seers who are free from craving declare that Nibbāna is an objective 
state (63) which is deathless, absolutely endless, non-conditioned (64), and 
incomparable.</p>

<p>Thus, as fourfold the Tathāgatas reveal the Ultimate Entities-consciousness 
mental states, matter, and Nibbāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Abhidhamma Compendium this is the sixth chapter, which deals with the 
analysis of matter. </p>

<a name='3-13' href='?#3-13'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>57. <i>Rūpas</i> do not arise singly but collectively in groups. There are 21 
such material groups. </p>

<p>As all mental states possess four common characteristics, so <i>rūpas</i>
found in the aforesaid groups possess four salient characteristics. For 
instance, in the &#39;eye-decad&#39; all the ten associated <i>rūpas</i> arise and cease 
together <i>(ekuppāda-ekanirodha).
</i>The earth-element, which is one of the ten, acts as a basis for the 
remaining nine <i>(ekanissaya).</i>
All these ten coexist <i>(sahavutti). </i>It should be understood that the 
earth-element of the &#39;eye-decad&#39; does not serve as a basis for the associated <i>
rūpas</i> of the &#39;ear-decad&#39;. These four characteristics apply only to the 
associated <i>rūpas</i> of each particular group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>58. This section deals with the manner in which these material groups come 
into being and how they exist during lifetime, at the moment of conception, and 
in different states of birth.</p>

<p>According to Buddhism there are four kinds of birth - namely, egg-born beings <i>
(andaja),</i> womb-born beings <i>(jalābuja),</i> moisture-born beings <i>
(samsedaja),
</i>and beings having spontaneous births <i>(opapātika).</i> </p>

<p>Embryos that take moisture as nidus for their growth, like certain lowly 
forms of animal life, belong to the third class. </p>

<p>Sometimes moisture-born beings lack certain senses and have no sex. They all 
must possess a consciousness as they are all endowed with the base-decad, that 
is, the seat of consciousness. Beings having a spontaneous birth are generally 
invisible to the physical eye. Conditioned by their past Kamma, they appear 
spontaneously, without passing through an embryonic stage. Petas and Devas 
normally, and Brahmas belong to this class.</p>

<p>Some of those who have spontaneous birth in the <i>kāma</i>-sphere are 
asexual. But all beings who are Spontaneously born in the <i>rūpa</i>-sphere are 
not only asexual but are also devoid of sensitive nose, tongue, and body, though 
they possess those physical organs. The sensitive material qualities <i>
(pasādarūpas) </i>of those particular organs are lost as they are not of any 
practical use to Brahmas. </p>

<p>Egg-born beings are also included among womb-born beings. At the moment of 
conception they all obtain the three decads of body, sex, and the seat of 
consciousness. At times some are devoid of both masculinity and femininity. From 
this it is seen that even eggs are constituted with a consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>59. <b>Nibbāna</b>, Sanskrit Nirvāna, is composed of <i>ni</i> and <i>vāna.</i>
<i>Ni + vāna </i>= Nivāna = Nibāna = Nibbāna. <i>Ni</i> is a particle implying 
negation. <i>Vāna</i> means weaving or craving. It is this craving which acts as 
a cord to connect the series of lives of any particular individual in the course 
of his wanderings in Samsāra.</p>

<p>As long as one is entangled by craving or attachment, one accumulates fresh 
Karmic forces which must materialize in one form or other in the eternal cycle 
of birth and death. When all forms of craving are extirpated, Karmic forces 
cease to operate, and one, in conventional terms, attains Nibbāna, escaping the 
cycle of birth and death. The Buddhist conception of Deliverance is this escape 
from the ever-recurring cycle of birth and death, and is not merely an escape 
from &#39;sin and hell&#39;. </p>

<p>Etymologically, Nibbāna, derived from <i>ni + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
vu,</i> to weave, means non-craving or non-attachment , or &#39;departure from 
craving&#39;. Strictly speaking, Nibbāna is that Dhamma which is gained by the 
complete destruction of all forms of craving. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is also derived from <i>ni + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
vā,</i> to blow. In that case Nibbāna means the blowing out, the extinction, or 
the annihilation of the flames of lust, hatred, and ignorance. It should be 
understood that the mere destruction of passions is not Nibbāna <i>(khayamattam 
eva na nibbānanti vattabbam). </i>It is only the means to gain Nibbāna, and is 
not an end in itself. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is an ultimate reality <i>(vatthu-dhamma)</i> which is supramundane <i>
(lokuttara), </i>that is, beyond the world of mind and body or the five 
&#39;aggregates&#39;. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is to be understood by intuitive knowledge and inferential knowledge <i>
(paccakkha or pativedha ñāna and anumāna or anubodha ñāna). </i>To express both 
ideas it is stated that Nibbāna is to be realized by means of the wisdom 
pertaining to the four Paths of Sainthood and that it becomes an object to the 
Paths and Fruits. </p>

<p>Intrinsically <i>(sabhāvato)</i> Nibbāna is peaceful (santi). As such it is 
unique <i>(kevala).</i> This single Nibbāna is viewed as twofold according to 
the way it is experienced before and after death. The text uses a simple but 
recondite Pāli phrase - <i>kāranapariyāyena.</i> The Ceylon Commentary explains 
the cause for naming it as such with respect to its having or not having the 
aggregates as the remainder <i>(sa-upādisesādivasena paññāpane kāranabhūtassa 
upādisesābhāvābhāvassa lesena).</i> Adding a note on this term S. Z. Aung 
writes: &quot;The Ceylon Commentaries explain it by <i>paññāpane kāranassa lesena</i> 
- by way of device of the means (of knowing) in the matter of language.&quot; - 
Compendium, p. 168, n. 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Saupādisesa</b> - <i>Sa</i> = with; <i>upadi</i> = aggregates (mind and 
body); <i>sesa</i> = remaining. <i>Upādi</i>, derived from<i> upa + ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> dā,</i> to take, means the five aggregates as they are firmly grasped 
by craving and false views. It also signifies passions <i>(kilesas). </i>
According to the text and the Commentarial interpretations, Nibbāna, experienced 
by Sotāpannas, Sakadāgāmis, and Anāgāmis, is <i>saupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i> as 
they have the body and some passions still remaining. Nibbāna of the Arahats is 
also <i>saupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i>
as they have the body still remaining. It is only the Nibbāna of the Arahats 
after their death that is termed <i>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i> because the 
aggregates and the passions are discarded by them. </p>

<p>Itivuttaka refers to these two kinds of Nibbāna, but mention is made only of 
Nibbāna comprehended by Arahats. It states: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>60. <b>Suññata</b> - Devoid of lust, hatred, and ignorance or of all 
conditioned things. Void here does not mean that Nibbāna is &#39;nothingness&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>61. <b>Animitta</b> - Free from the signs of lust, etc., or from the signs of 
all conditioned things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>62. <b>Appanihita</b> - Free from the hankerings of lust, etc., or because it 
is not longed for with any feelings of craving. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>63. <b>Padam</b> - Here the term is used in the sense of an objective reality <i>
(vatthu-dhamma).</i> &#39;State&#39; does not exactly convey the meaning of the Pāli 
term. It may be argued whether Nibbāna could strictly be called either a state 
or a process. In Pāli it is designated as a &#39;Dhamma&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>64. <b>Asankhata</b> - Nibbāna is the only Dhamma which is not conditioned by 
any cause. Hence it is eternal and is neither a cause nor an effect. </p>
