<h2>Summary of Rebirth Procedure</h2>

<p><a name='8-22' href='?#8-22'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-23' href='?#8-23'>&nbsp;</a>§1. Thus, according to thought-processes, the life&#39;s course (extending from 
birth to decease) has been explained. Now the summary of the procedure at 
rebirth will be told. </p>

<p><a name='8-24' href='?#8-24'>&nbsp;</a>§2. In the summary of process-freed consciousness, four sets of four should 
be understood as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) four planes of life (1); </li>
  <li>(ii) four modes of rebirth; </li>
  <li>(iii) four kinds of actions; </li>
  <li>(iv) fourfold advent of death. </li>
</ul>

<h3>i. Four Planes of Life</h3>

<p><a name='8-25' href='?#8-25'>&nbsp;</a>Of these, the four planes of life are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Unhappy plane (2); </li>
  <li>2. Sensuous blissful plane (3); </li>
  <li>3. Rūpavācara plane (4); </li>
  <li>4. Arūpavācara plane (5). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-26' href='?#8-26'>&nbsp;</a>Among these the Unhappy plane is fourfold - namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) Woeful State (6), </li>
  <li>(ii) Animal Kingdom (7), </li>
  <li>(iii) Peta Sphere (8), </li>
  <li>(iv) the Host of Asuras (9). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-27' href='?#8-27'>&nbsp;</a>The Sensuous blissful plane is sevenfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) Human Realm ( 10),
  </li>
  <li>(ii) the Realm of the Four Kings (11), </li>
  <li>(iii) the Realm of the Thirty-three gods (12), </li>
  <li>(iv) the Realm of the Yāma gods (13), </li>
  <li>(v) the Delightful Realm (14), </li>
  <li>(vi) the Realm of the gods who rejoice in (their own) creations (15),&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li>(vii) the Realm of the gods who lord over the creations of others (16). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-28' href='?#8-28'>&nbsp;</a>These eleven kinds of sphere constitute the Kāmāvacara plane. </p>

<p><a name='8-29' href='?#8-29'>&nbsp;</a>The Rūpavācara plane is sixteen fold - namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) the first jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>1. the Realm of Brahma&#39;s Retinue, </li>
    <li>2. the Realm of Brahma&#39;s Ministers,</li>
    <li>3. the Mahā Brahmā Realm (17); </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(ii) the second jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>4. the Realm of Minor Lustre, </li>
    <li>5. the Realm of Infinite Lustre, and </li>
    <li>6. the Realm of Radiant Lustre; </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(iii) the third jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>7. the Realm of Minor Aura, </li>
    <li>8. the Realm of Infinite Aura, and </li>
    <li>9. the Realm of Steady Aura; </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(iv) the fourth jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>10. the Realm of Great Reward, </li>
    <li>11. the Realm of Mindless Beings (18), and </li>
    <li>12. the Pure Abodes (19). </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-30' href='?#8-30'>&nbsp;</a>The Pure Abodes are fivefold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. the Durable Realm, </li>
  <li>ii. the Serene Realm, </li>
  <li>iii. the Beautiful Realm, </li>
  <li>iv. the Clear-sighted Realm, and </li>
  <li>v. the Highest Realm. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-31' href='?#8-31'>&nbsp;</a>The Arūpāvacara plane (20) is fourfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) the Realm of Infinite Space, </li>
  <li>(ii) the Realm of Infinite Consciousness. </li>
  <li>(iii) the Realm of Nothingness, </li>
  <li>(iv) the Realm of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-32' href='?#8-32'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-33' href='?#8-33'>&nbsp;</a>§ 3. In the Pure Abodes no worldlings, Stream-Winners (<font SIZE="2">See p. </font><a HREF="#page68">
*</a><font SIZE="2">.)</font>, or Once-Returners are born in any way. </p>

<p><a name='8-34' href='?#8-34'>&nbsp;</a>The Ariyas (those who have attained the four stages of Sainthood, all 
worldings are called Non-Ariyas) are not born in mindless Realms and Woeful 
States. In other planes are born both Ariyas and Non-Ariyas. </p>

<p><a name='8-35' href='?#8-35'>&nbsp;</a>Herein these are the fourfold planes. </p>

<p><a name='8-36' href='?#8-36'>&nbsp;</a><b>1. Bhūmi. </b>derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>bhu,</i>
to be, lit., means a place where beings exist. </p>

<p><a name='8-37' href='?#8-37'>&nbsp;</a>According to Buddhism the earth, an almost insignificant speck in the 
universe, is not the only habitable world, and humans are not the only living 
beings, Infinite are world systems and so are living beings. Nor is &quot;the 
impregnated ovum the only route to rebirth&quot; &quot;By traversing one cannot reach the 
end of the world,&quot; says the Buddha.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a name='8-38' href='?#8-38'>&nbsp;</a>* <font SIZE="2">&quot;There are about 1,000,000 planetary systems in the Milky 
Way in which life exists.&quot; See Fred Hoyle, The Nature of the Universe, pp.

<p><a name='8-39' href='?#8-39'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-40' href='?#8-40'>&nbsp;</a><b>2. Apāya</b> = <i>apa + aya.</i> That which is devoid of happiness is 
apāya. It is viewed both as a mental state and as a place. </p>

<p><a name='8-41' href='?#8-41'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-42' href='?#8-42'>&nbsp;</a>3. States where sense-pleasures abound. See p. <a HREF="#page10">*</a>.

<p><a name='8-44' href='?#8-44'>&nbsp;</a>4. and 5. See p. <a HREF="#page11">*</a>.</p>

<p><a name='8-45' href='?#8-45'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-46' href='?#8-46'>&nbsp;</a>6. <b>Niraya</b> = <i>ni + aya;</i> devoid of happiness. According to 
Buddhism there are several woeful states where beings atone for their evil 
kamma. They are not eternal hells where beings are subject to endless suffering. 
Upon the exhaustion of the evil Kamma there is a possibility for beings born in 
such states to be reborn in good states as the result of their past good 
actions. </p>

<p><a name='8-47' href='?#8-47'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-48' href='?#8-48'>&nbsp;</a>7. <b>Tiracchāna</b> = <i>tiro,</i> across; <i>acchāna,</i> going. Animals 
are so called because as a rule quadrupeds walk horizontally. Buddhist belief is 
that beings are born as animals on account of evil Kamma. There is, however, the 
possibility for animals to be born as human beings. Strictly speaking, it should 
be said that an animal may manifest itself in the form of a human being, or <i>
vice versa,</i>
just as an electric current can be manifested in the forms of light, heat, and 
motion successively - one not necessarily being evolved from the other. An 
animal may be born in a blissful state as a result of the good Kamma accumulated 
in the past. There are at times certain animals, particularly dogs and cats, who 
live a more comfortable life than even human beings. It is also due to their 
past good Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-49' href='?#8-49'>&nbsp;</a>It is one&#39;s Kamma that determines the nature of one&#39;s material form, which 
varies according to the skill or unskilfulness of one&#39;s actions. And this again 
depends entirely on the evolution of one&#39;s understanding of reality. </p>

<p><a name='8-50' href='?#8-50'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-51' href='?#8-51'>&nbsp;</a>8. <b>Peta</b> = <i>pa + ita;</i> lit., departed beings, or (those) 
absolutely devoid of happiness. They are not disembodied spirits or ghosts. 
Although they possess material forms, generally they are invisible to the 
physical eye. They have no plane of their own, but live in forests, dirty 
surroundings, etc. </p>

<p><a name='8-52' href='?#8-52'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-53' href='?#8-53'>&nbsp;</a>9. <b>Asura</b> - lit., those who do not sport or those who do not shine. 
These Asuras should be distinguished from another class of Asuras who are 
opposed to Devas, and who live in the Tāvatimsa plane (see note 12). </p>

<p><a name='8-54' href='?#8-54'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-55' href='?#8-55'>&nbsp;</a>10. <b>Manussa</b> - lit., those who have an uplifted or developed mind
<i>(mano ussannam etesam). </i>Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>Manushya,</i> which 
means the sons of <i>Manu.</i> They are so called because they became civilized 
after <i>Manu</i>
the seer. </p>

<p><a name='8-56' href='?#8-56'>&nbsp;</a>The human realm is a mixture of both pain and happiness. Bodhisattas prefer 
the human realm, as they get a better opportunity to serve the world and perfect 
the requisites for Buddha hood. Buddhas are always born as human beings. </p>

<p><a name='8-57' href='?#8-57'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-58' href='?#8-58'>&nbsp;</a>11. <b>Cātummahārājika</b> - This is the lowest of the heavenly realms where 
the four Guardian Deities reside with their followers.</p>

<p><a name='8-59' href='?#8-59'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-60' href='?#8-60'>&nbsp;</a>12. <b>Tāvatimsa</b> - lit., thirty-three. Sakka, the king of the gods, 
resides in this celestial plane. The origin of the name is attributed to a story 
which states that thirty-three selfless volunteers led by Magha, having 
performed charitable deeds, were born in this heavenly realm. </p>

<p><a name='8-61' href='?#8-61'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-62' href='?#8-62'>&nbsp;</a>13. <b>Yāma </b>- derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>yam,</i>
to destroy. That which destroys pain is <i>yāma.</i></p>

<p><a name='8-63' href='?#8-63'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-64' href='?#8-64'>&nbsp;</a>14. <b>Tusita</b> - lit., happy-dwellers. Traditional belief is that the 
future Bodhisatta dwells at present in this celestial plane, awaiting the right 
opportunity to be born as a human being and become a Buddha. </p>

<p><a name='8-65' href='?#8-65'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-66' href='?#8-66'>&nbsp;</a>15. <b>Nimmānarati</b> - Those who delight in the created mansions. </p>

<p><a name='8-67' href='?#8-67'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-68' href='?#8-68'>&nbsp;</a>16. <b>Paranimmitavasavatti</b> - lit., those who bring under their sway 
things created by others. </p>

<p><a name='8-69' href='?#8-69'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-70' href='?#8-70'>&nbsp;</a>These are the six Celestial planes - all temporary blissful abodes - where 
beings are supposed to live happily enjoying fleeting pleasures of sense. 
Superior to these Sensuous planes are the Brahma realms where beings delight in 
jhānic bliss, achieved by renouncing sense-desires. </p>

<p><a name='8-71' href='?#8-71'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-72' href='?#8-72'>&nbsp;</a>17. These are the three Brahma realms where beings who have developed the 
first jhāna are born. The lowest of these three is Brahma Pārisajja, which, 
literally, means &quot;Those who are born amongst the attendants of Mahā-Brahmas.&quot; 
The second is Brahma Purohita which means Brahma&#39;s Ministers. The highest of the 
first three is Mahā Brahmā. It is so called because these beings exceed others 
in happiness, beauty and age-limit, owing to the intrinsic merit of their mental 
development. </p>

<p><a name='8-73' href='?#8-73'>&nbsp;</a>Those who develop the first jhāna to a normal extent are born in the first 
plane; those who have developed to a medium degree are born in the second; and 
those who have perfect control of the first jhāna are born amongst the Mahā 
Brahmas in the third plane. The three divisions of the other jhānic planes 
should be similarly understood. </p>

<p><a name='8-74' href='?#8-74'>&nbsp;</a>18. <b>Asasññasatta</b> - This is supposed to be a plane where beings are 
born without a consciousness. Here only a material flux exists, normally both 
mind and matter are inseparable. By the power of meditation it is possible, at 
times, to separate matter from mind as in this particular case. When Arahat 
attains the <i>Nirodha</i> <i>Samāpatti,</i>
his consciousness ceases to exist temporarily. Such a state is almost 
inconceivable to us. But there may be many inconceivable things which are actual 
facts. </p>

<p><a name='8-75' href='?#8-75'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-76' href='?#8-76'>&nbsp;</a>19. Suddhāvāsa - Only Anāgāmis and Arahats are found in these planes. Those 
who attain Anāgāmi in other planes are born in these Pure Abodes. Later, they 
attain Arahatship and live in those planes till their life-term is over. </p>

<p><a name='8-77' href='?#8-77'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-78' href='?#8-78'>&nbsp;</a>20. See p. <a HREF="#page11">*</a>. All these four are immaterial planes. </p>

<p><a name='8-79' href='?#8-79'>&nbsp;</a>It should be remarked that the Buddha did not attempt to expound any 
cosmological theory. </p>

<p><a name='8-80' href='?#8-80'>&nbsp;</a>The essence of the Buddha&#39;s teaching is not affected by the existence or 
non-existence of these planes. No one is bound to believe anything if it does 
not appeal to his reason. Nor is it right to reject anything just because it 
cannot be conceived by one&#39;s limited knowledge. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><a name='8-185' href='?#8-185'>&nbsp;</a>29. <b>Kamma,</b> Sanskrit Karma, lit. means action, of doing. Strictly 
speaking, Kamma means all moral and immoral volition (cetanā). It covers all 
that is included in the phrase - &quot;thought, word and deed&quot;. It is the law of 
moral causation. In other words, it is action and reaction in the ethical realm, 
or &quot;action influence&quot; as Westerners say. It is not fate or predestination. It is 
one&#39;s own doing reacting on oneself. </p>

<p><a name='8-186' href='?#8-186'>&nbsp;</a>Every volitional action, except that of a Buddha or of an Arahat, is called 
Kamma. The Buddhas and Arahats do not accumulate fresh Kamma as they have 
eradicated ignorance and craving, the roots of Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-187' href='?#8-187'>&nbsp;</a>Kamma is action, and Vipāka, fruit or result, is its reaction. It is the 
cause and the effect. Like a seed is Kamma. Vipāka (effect) is like the fruit 
arising from the tree. As we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime in this life or 
in a future birth. What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present 
or in the past. </p>

<p><a name='8-188' href='?#8-188'>&nbsp;</a>Kamma is a law in itself, and it operates in its own field without the 
intervention of an external independent ruling agency. </p>

<p><a name='8-189' href='?#8-189'>&nbsp;</a>Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its due effect. The cause 
produces the effect; the effect explains the cause. The seed produces the fruit; 
the fruit explains the seed; such is their relationship. Even so are Kamma and 
its effect: &quot;the effect already blooms in the cause&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='8-190' href='?#8-190'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma, Kamma constitutes the twelve types of immoral 
consciousness, eight types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere <i>
(kāmāvacara),</i>
five types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Forms <i>
(rūpāvacara), </i>and four types of moral consciousness pertaining to the 
Formless Realms <i>(arūpāvacara). </i></p>

<p><a name='8-191' href='?#8-191'>&nbsp;</a>The eight types of supramundane consciousness <i>(lokuttara citta)</i>
are not regarded as Kamma and <i>vipāka,</i> because they tend to eradicate the 
roots of Kamma that condition rebirth. In the supramundane consciousness wisdom <i>
(paññā)</i>
is predominant, while in the ordinary types of consciousness volition <i>
(cetanā)</i> is predominant. </p>

<p><a name='8-192' href='?#8-192'>&nbsp;</a>These twenty-nine types of consciousness are called Kamma because the 
reproductive power is inherent in them. Just as every object is accompanied by a 
shadow, even so every volitional activity is accompanied by its due effect. </p>

<p><a name='8-193' href='?#8-193'>&nbsp;</a>These types of consciousness that are experienced as inevitable consequences 
of good and bad thoughts, are called resultant consciousness <i>(vipāka).</i>
The 23 types (7+8+8) of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere, 
the five types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Form, and 
the four types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Formless Realms, are 
called <i>vipāka</i> or fruition of Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-194' href='?#8-194'>&nbsp;</a>(See The Life of the Buddha and his Teachings, pp. 333-391, and Manual of 
Buddhism, pp. 19-88)</p>

<p><a name='8-195' href='?#8-195'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-196' href='?#8-196'>&nbsp;</a>30. Every birth is conditioned by a past good or bad Kamma which predominates 
at the moment of death. The Kamma that conditions the future birth is called 
Reproductive (Janaka) Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-197' href='?#8-197'>&nbsp;</a>The death of a person is merely &quot;the temporary end of a temporary 
phenomenon&quot;. Though the present form perishes, another form which is neither the 
same nor absolutely different, takes its place according to the potential 
thought-vibrations generated at the death moment, as the Kammic force which 
propels the life-flux still survives. It is this last thought, which is 
technically called Reproductive Kamma, that determines the state of a person in 
his subsequent birth. This may be either a good or bad Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-198' href='?#8-198'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-199' href='?#8-199'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentary, Janaka Kamma is that which produces mental 
aggregates and material aggregates at the moment of conception. The initial 
consciousness, which is termed the <i>patisandhi viññāna</i> 
(rebirth-consciousness), is conditioned by this Janaka Kamma. Simultaneous with 
the arising of the rebirth-consciousness there arise the body-decade, 
sex-decade, and base-decade <i>(kāya-bhāva-vatthu dasaka). </i></p>

<p><a name='8-200' href='?#8-200'>&nbsp;</a>The body-decade is composed of the four elements - namely,  </p>

<ul>
  <li>the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> </li>
  <li>the element of cohesion <i>(āpo), </i></li>
  <li>the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> </li>
  <li>the element of motion <i>(vāyo);</i> </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-201' href='?#8-201'>&nbsp;</a>their four derivatives <i>(upādārūpa) </i>- namely,  </p>

<ul>
  <li>colour <i>(vanna),</i> </li>
  <li>odour <i>(gandha),</i> </li>
  <li>taste <i>(rasa),</i> </li>
  <li>nutritive essence <i>(ojā);</i> </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-202' href='?#8-202'>&nbsp;</a>vitality <i>(jīvitindriya),</i> and body <i>(kāya). </i>The sex-decade and 
the base-decade also consist of the first nine plus sex <i>(bhāva)</i> and seat 
of consciousness <i>(vatthu) </i>respectively.</p>

<p><a name='8-203' href='?#8-203'>&nbsp;</a>From this it is evident that the sex is determined at the very conception of 
a being. I t is conditioned by Kamma and is not a fortuitous combination of 
sperm and ovum cells. Pain and happiness, which one experiences in the course of 
one&#39;s lifetime, are the inevitable consequences of Janaka Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-204' href='?#8-204'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-205' href='?#8-205'>&nbsp;</a>31. <b>Upatthambhaka</b> - that which comes near the Reproductive Kamma and 
supports it. It is either good or bad, and it assists or maintains the action of 
the Reproductive Kamma in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. Immediately after the 
conception till the death moment, this Kamma steps forward to support the 
Reproductive Kamma. A moral Supportive Kamma assists in giving health, wealth, 
happiness, etc., to the person concerned. An immoral Supportive Kamma, on the 
other hand, assists in giving pain, sorrow, etc., to the person born with an 
immoral Reproductive Kamma as, for instance, to a beast of burden. </p>

<p><a name='8-206' href='?#8-206'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-207' href='?#8-207'>&nbsp;</a>32. <b>Upapīdaka</b> - Obstructive or Counteractive Kamma which, unlike the 
previous one, tends to weaken, interrupt and retard the fruition of the 
Reproductive Kamma. For instance, a person born with a good Reproductive Kamma 
maybe subject to various ailments, etc., thus preventing him from enjoying the 
blissful results of his good action. An animal, on the other hand, who is born 
with a bad Reproductive Kamma, may lead a comfortable life by getting good food, 
lodging, etc., as a result of his good Counteractive Kamma preventing the 
fruition of the evil Reproductive Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-208' href='?#8-208'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-209' href='?#8-209'>&nbsp;</a>33. <b>Upaghātaka</b> - According to the Law of Kamma the potential energy of 
the Reproductive Kamma could be nullified by a more powerful opposing Kamma of 
the past, which, seeking an opportunity, may quite unexpectedly operate, just as 
a counteractive powerful force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow and bring 
it down to the ground. Such an action is called Destructive Kamma, which is more 
effective than the previous two in that it not only obstructs but also destroys 
the whole force. This Destructive Kamma also may be either good or bad. </p>

<p><a name='8-210' href='?#8-210'>&nbsp;</a>As an instance of the operation of all four, the case of Devadatta, who 
attempted to kill the Buddha and who caused a schism in the Sangha, may be 
cited. His good Reproductive Kamma conditioned him a birth in a royal family. 
His continued comforts and prosperity were due to the action of the Supportive 
Kamma. The counteractive Kamma came into operation when he was subject to much 
humiliation as a result of his being excommunicated from the Sangha. Finally the 
Destructive Kamma brought his life to a miserable end. </p>

<p><a name='8-211' href='?#8-211'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-212' href='?#8-212'>&nbsp;</a>34. <b>Garuka</b> - which means either weighty or serious, may be either good 
or bad. It produces its results in this life, or in the next for certain. If 
good, it is purely mental as in the case of the <i>jhānas.</i> Otherwise it is 
verbal or bodily. The five kinds of immoral Weighty Kamma according to their 
gravity are: - (i) the creation of a schism in the Sangha, (ii) the wounding of 
a Buddha, (iii) the murder of an Arahat, (iv) matricide, and (v) parricide. </p>

<p><a name='8-213' href='?#8-213'>&nbsp;</a>These are also known as ānantariya Kamma because they definitely produce 
their effects in the subsequent life. Permanent Skepticism <i>(niyata 
micchāditthi)</i> is also termed one of the Weighty Kammas. </p>

<p><a name='8-214' href='?#8-214'>&nbsp;</a>If, for instance, any person were to develop the <i>jhānas</i> and later were 
to commit one of these heinous crimes, his good Kamma would be obliterated by 
the powerful evil Kamma. His subsequent birth would be conditioned by the evil 
Kamma in spite of his having gained the <i>jhānas</i> earlier. Devadatta lost 
his psychic powers and was born in an evil state, because he wounded the Buddha 
and caused a schism in the Sangha. </p>

<p><a name='8-215' href='?#8-215'>&nbsp;</a>King Ajātasattu would have attained the first stage of sainthood if he had 
not committed parricide. In this case the powerful evil Kamma acted as an 
obstacle to his gaining sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='8-216' href='?#8-216'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-217' href='?#8-217'>&nbsp;</a>35. <b>āsanna,</b> or Death-proximate Kamma, is that which one does or 
remembers immediately before the dying moment. Owing to its significance in 
determining the future birth, the custom of reminding the dying person of his 
good deeds and making him do good acts on his death-bed still prevails in 
Buddhist countries. </p>

<p><a name='8-218' href='?#8-218'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receive a good birth if 
fortunately he remembers or does a good act at the last moment. A story runs 
that a certain executioner, who casually happened to give some alms to the 
Venerable Sāriputta, remembered this good act at the dying moment and was born 
in a state of bliss. This does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth he 
will be exempt from the effects of the evil deeds accumulated during his 
lifetime. They will have their due effects as occasions arise. </p>

<p><a name='8-219' href='?#8-219'>&nbsp;</a>At times a good person may die unhappily by suddenly remembering an evil act 
of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought, perchance compelled by 
unfavourable circumstances. Queen Mallikā, the consort of King Pasenadi, led a 
righteous life, but as a result of remembering, at her death moment, a lie which 
she had uttered, she had to suffer for about seven days in a state of misery. </p>

<p><a name='8-220' href='?#8-220'>&nbsp;</a>These are only exceptional cases. Such reverse changes of birth account for 
the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and of vicious children to 
virtuous parents. As a rule the last thought-process is conditioned by the 
general conduct of a person. </p>

<p><a name='8-221' href='?#8-221'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-222' href='?#8-222'>&nbsp;</a>36. <b>ācinna Kamma</b> is that which one habitually performs and recollects 
and for which one has a great liking. </p>

<p><a name='8-223' href='?#8-223'>&nbsp;</a>Habits, whether good or bad, become second nature. They tend to form the 
character of a person. At leisure moments we often engage ourselves in our 
habitual thoughts and deeds. In the same way at the death-moment, unless 
influenced by other circumstances, we, as a rule, recall to mind such thoughts 
and deeds. </p>

<p><a name='8-224' href='?#8-224'>&nbsp;</a>Cunda, a butcher, who was living in the vicinity of the Buddha&#39;s Monastery, 
died squealing like a pig because he was earning his living by slaughtering 
pigs. </p>

<p><a name='8-225' href='?#8-225'>&nbsp;</a>King Dutthagāmani of Ceylon was in the habit of giving alms to the Bhikkhus 
before he took his meals. It was this habitual Kamma that gladdened him at the 
dying moment and gave him birth in the Tusita Realm.</p>

<p><a name='8-226' href='?#8-226'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-227' href='?#8-227'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Katattā</b> - Reserve or Cumulative Kamma. Literally, it means 
&quot;because done&quot;. All actions that are done once and soon forgotten belong to this 
category. This is as it were the reserve fund of a particular being. </p>

<p><a name='8-228' href='?#8-228'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-229' href='?#8-229'>&nbsp;</a>38. <b>Ditthadhammavedanāya Kamma</b> is that which is experienced in this 
particular life. <i>Ditthadhamma</i> means this present life. </p>

<p><a name='8-230' href='?#8-230'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma one does both good and evil during the <i>javana</i>
process which usually lasts for seven thought-moments. The effect of the first 
thought-moment, being the weakest, one may reap in this life itself. This is 
called the Immediately Effective Kamma. If it does not operate in this life, it 
is called Defunct or Ineffective <i>(ahosi).</i> The next weakest is the seventh 
thought-moment. Its evil effect one may reap in the subsequent birth. This is 
called <i>Upapajjavedanīya Kamma.</i>
This, too, becomes ineffective if it does not operate in the second birth. The 
effects of the intermediate thought-moments may take place at any time until one 
attains Nibbāna. This type of Kamma is known as Aparāpariyavedanīya - 
Indefinitely Effective. No one, not even the Buddhas and Arahats, is exempt from 
this class of Kamma, which one may experience in the course of one&#39;s wanderings 
in Samsāra. There is no special class of Kamma known as
<i>ahosi,</i> but when such actions that should produce their effects in the 
present life or in a subsequent life do not operate, they are termed 
Ineffective. </p>

<p><a name='8-231' href='?#8-231'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-232' href='?#8-232'>&nbsp;</a>39. <b>Bāhullavuttito</b> - This term is used because these actions may be 
done through the other doors as well. </p>

<p><a name='8-233' href='?#8-233'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-234' href='?#8-234'>&nbsp;</a>40. <b>Kāyaviññatti</b> - expressing the intention through bodily movements. </p>

<p><a name='8-236' href='?#8-236'>&nbsp;</a>41. <b>Vacīviññatti</b> - expressing the intention through speech. </p>

<p><a name='8-238' href='?#8-238'>&nbsp;</a>42. By false beliefs are meant the following three misconceptions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. Everything has sprung without a cause <i>(ahetuka ditthi).</i> </li>
  <li>ii. Good and bad produce no effect <i>(akiriya ditthi)</i> and </li>
  <li>iii. There is no after-life <i>(natthika ditthi).</i></li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-239' href='?#8-239'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-241' href='?#8-241'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-242' href='?#8-242'>&nbsp;</a>44. The evil effects of the twelve types of immoral consciousness are the 
seven types of rootless resultant consciousness. They may take effect in the 
course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p><a name='8-243' href='?#8-243'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-244' href='?#8-244'>&nbsp;</a>45. The desirable effects of moral actions are the eight types of Rootless 
resultant consciousness and the eight types of Beautiful resultant 
consciousness. The effects of the eight types of moral consciousness may not 
only serve as rebirth consciousness but also give rise to different types of 
resultant consciousness in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p><a name='8-245' href='?#8-245'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-246' href='?#8-246'>&nbsp;</a>46. <b>Ukkattha</b> - lit., up <i>(u)</i> drawn <i>(<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
kas). </i>A highest class of moral Kamma is that which is attended with good 
causes before and after the commission of the act. For instance, alms given to 
the most virtuous with righteously obtained wealth, with no later repentance, is 
considered a &#39;highest&#39; moral Kamma.</p>

<p><a name='8-247' href='?#8-247'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-248' href='?#8-248'>&nbsp;</a>47. <b>Omaka</b> - Inferior. While giving alms one may experience a moral 
consciousness with the three good roots. But, if he were to give to the vicious 
with unrighteously obtained wealth, and with later repentance, it is regarded as 
an inferior Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-272' href='?#8-272'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-273' href='?#8-273'>&nbsp;</a>§ 11. The advent of death (51) is fourfold, namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) through the expiration of the age-limit (52), </li>
  <li>(ii) through the expiration of the (Reproductive) Kammic force (53) </li>
  <li>(iii) through the (simultaneous) expiration of both (54), and </li>
  <li>(iv) through (the intervention of a) Destructive Kamma (55). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-274' href='?#8-274'>&nbsp;</a>Now, to those who are about to die, at the moment of death, by the power of 
Kamma, one of the following presents itself through any of the six doors: </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. a Kamma that produces rebirth in the subsequent birth enters (the 
  mind-door) according to circumstances (56); </li>
  <li>ii. an object (51) such as a pre-perceived form and the like, or anything 
  that was instrumental in the performance of the Kamma. </li>
  <li>iii. a symbolic destiny sign (58) that should be got and experienced in 
  the subsequent birth-place. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-275' href='?#8-275'>&nbsp;</a>Thereafter attending to that object thus presented (59), the stream of 
consciousness, in accordance with the Kamma that is to be matured, whether pure 
or corrupted, and in conformity with the place where one is to be born, 
continually flows, inclining mostly towards that state. Or that 
birth-reproductive Kamma presents itself to a sense-door in the way of renewing. </p>

<p><a name='8-276' href='?#8-276'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-277' href='?#8-277'>&nbsp;</a>§ 12. To one who is nearing death, either at the end of a thought-process or 
at the dissolution of bhavanga, the decease-consciousness, the consummation of 
the present life, arises and ceases in the way of death. </p>

<p><a name='8-278' href='?#8-278'>&nbsp;</a>Immediately after that (death-consciousness) has ceased, a rebirth 
consciousness arises and is established in the subsequent existence, based on 
the object thus obtained, either with or without the heart-base (60) as is 
appropriate, generated by Kamma <i>(sankhāra)</i> that is enveloped by latent 
ignorance and rooted in latent craving. That rebirth (or relinking) 
consciousness, so called because it links together the two consecutive 
existences, is conjoined with its mental co-adjuncts, and acts as the 
fore-runner to the conascent states as their locus (or foundation - <i>
adhitthānabhāvena).
</p>

<p><a name='8-279' href='?#8-279'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

    </i><p><a name='8-280' href='?#8-280'>&nbsp;</a>§ 13. Herein in the dying thought-process only five feeble moments 
(normally seven thought-moments), of <i>javana</i> should be expected. </p>

<p><a name='8-281' href='?#8-281'>&nbsp;</a>Therefore when death occurs while the present object is being presented to 
the avenues (i.e., <i>kamma nimitta</i> to one of the five sense-doors or <i>
gati nimitta</i> to the mind-door) then the rebirth-consciousness and the <i>
bhavanga</i>-consciousness take a present object. </p>

<p><a name='8-282' href='?#8-282'>&nbsp;</a>Thus in rebirth in a Sense-Sphere the <i>kamma nimitta</i> taken by (any of) 
the six doors, or the <i>gati nimitta,</i> may be past or present. </p>

<p><a name='8-283' href='?#8-283'>&nbsp;</a>But Kamma is perceived by the mind-door only as a past object. </p>

<p><a name='8-284' href='?#8-284'>&nbsp;</a>All these should be regarded as lesser objects (i.e., belonging to the <i>
kāma</i>-sphere).
</p>

<p><a name='8-285' href='?#8-285'>&nbsp;</a>In rebirth in the Realms of Forms the Kamma symbol which is a concept (such 
as earth device, etc.) becomes the object. </p>

<p><a name='8-286' href='?#8-286'>&nbsp;</a>So, too, in rebirth in Formless Realms, only a Kamma symbol which is a 
sublimated concept (such as a visualized space) becomes an object, according to 
circumstances. </p>

<p><a name='8-287' href='?#8-287'>&nbsp;</a>To the mindless beings only the vital nonad* establishes itself in the way of 
rebirth. Hence they are called materially reborn. Those born in Formless Realms 
are called mentally reborn. The rest are called materially and mentally reborn. </p>

<p><a name='8-290' href='?#8-290'>&nbsp;</a>§ 14. After one passes away from a Formless Realm, one is similarly born in a 
Formless Realm, but not in a lower Formless plane, and also in the Sense-Sphere 
with three roots. </p>

<p><a name='8-291' href='?#8-291'>&nbsp;</a>When one passes from a Realm of Form, one is not born without the three 
roots. After a birth with the three roots one seeks rebirth in all states. The 
rest (namely those with two roots and no roots) are reborn in the Sense-Spheres. </p>

<p><a name='8-292' href='?#8-292'>&nbsp;</a>Herein this is the procedure with regard to decease and rebirth. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><a name='8-293' href='?#8-293'>&nbsp;</a>51. &quot;Death is the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon.&quot; By death is meant 
the extinction of psychic life <i>(jīvitindriya),</i> heat <i>(usma = 
tejodhātu),</i> and consciousness <i>(viññāna),</i> of one individual in a 
particular existence. Death is not the complete annihilation of a being. Death 
in one place means birth in another place, just as, in conventional terms, the 
rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another place. </p>

<p><a name='8-294' href='?#8-294'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-295' href='?#8-295'>&nbsp;</a>52. What are commonly understood to be natural deaths due to old age may be 
classed under this category. </p>

<p><a name='8-296' href='?#8-296'>&nbsp;</a>To each of the various planes of existence is naturally assigned a definite 
age-limit, irrespective of the potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma that 
has yet to run. One must, however, succumb to death when the maximum age-limit 
is reached. It may also be said that if the Reproductive Kamma is extremely 
powerful, the Karmic energy rematerializes itself on the same plane, or on some 
higher plane as in the case of the devas. </p>

<p><a name='8-297' href='?#8-297'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-298' href='?#8-298'>&nbsp;</a>53. As a rule the thought, volition, or desire, which was extremely strong 
during lifetime becomes predominant at the moment of death, and conditions the 
subsequent birth. In this last thought-moment is present a special potentiality. 
When the potential energy of this Reproductive Kamma is exhausted, the organic 
activities of the material form, in which is corporealized the life-force, cease 
even before the approach of old age. </p>

<p><a name='8-299' href='?#8-299'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-300' href='?#8-300'>&nbsp;</a>54. If a person is born at a time when the age-limit is 80 years, and he dies 
at 80 owing to the exhaustion of the potential force of his Reproductive Kamma, 
his death is due to the simultaneous expiration of both age and Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-301' href='?#8-301'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-302' href='?#8-302'>&nbsp;</a>55. There are powerful actions which suddenly cut off the force of the 
Reproductive Kamma, even before the expiration of the life-term. A more powerful 
opposing force, for instance, can check the path of a flying arrow and bring it 
down to the ground. Similarly, a very powerful Kammic force of the past is 
capable of nullifying the potential energy of the dying reproductive <i>(janaka)</i> 
thought-moment, and thus destroy the life of a being. The death of Devadatta was 
due to an <i>upacchedaka</i> <i>kamma</i> which he committed during his 
lifetime. </p>

<p><a name='8-303' href='?#8-303'>&nbsp;</a>The first three types of death are collectively called <i>kālamarana</i>
(timely death), and the last one is known as akālamarana (untimely death). </p>

<p><a name='8-304' href='?#8-304'>&nbsp;</a>An oil lamp, for instance, may be extinguished owing to any of the following 
four causes, namely, the exhaustion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, 
simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil, and some extraneous cause like the 
gust of a wind. Death of a person may similarly be caused by any of the 
aforesaid four ways.</p>

<p><a name='8-305' href='?#8-305'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-306' href='?#8-306'>&nbsp;</a>56. As a person is about to die, a good or bad action may present itself 
before his mind&#39;s eye. It may be either a meritorious or a demeritorious Weighty 
action <i>(garuka kamma), </i>such as <i>jhānas</i> (ecstasies), or parricide 
etc. They are so powerful that they totally eclipse all other actions, and 
appear very vividly before the mental eye. If there is no Weighty action, he may 
take for his object of the dying thought a Kamma done or remembered immediately 
before death <i>(āsanna kamma). </i></p>

<p><a name='8-307' href='?#8-307'>&nbsp;</a>If it is a past action, strictly speaking, it is the good or bad thought 
experienced at the moment of performing the action, that recurs at the 
death-moment. </p>

<p><a name='8-308' href='?#8-308'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-309' href='?#8-309'>&nbsp;</a>57. <b>Kamma nimitta</b> is any sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea 
which was obtained at the time of the commission of the Kamma, such as knives in 
the case of a butcher, patients in the case of a physician, flowers in the case 
of a devotee, etc. </p>

<p><a name='8-310' href='?#8-310'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-311' href='?#8-311'>&nbsp;</a>58. By <b>gati nimitta</b> is meant some sign of the place where he is to 
take birth, an event which invariably happens to dying persons. When these 
indications of the future birth occur, and if they are bad, they can be turned 
into good. This is done by influencing the thoughts of the dying person, so that 
his good thoughts may now act as the Proximate Kamma and counteract the 
influence of the Reproductive Kamma which would otherwise affect his subsequent 
birth. </p>

<p><a name='8-312' href='?#8-312'>&nbsp;</a>These symbols of one&#39;s destiny may be hellish fires, forests, mountainous 
regions, mother&#39;s womb, celestial mansions, etc. </p>

<p><a name='8-313' href='?#8-313'>&nbsp;</a>The Kamma is presented to the mind-door. <i>Kamma nimitta</i> may be 
presented to any of the six doors according to circumstances. <i>Gati nimitta,</i> 
being always a physical sight, is presented to the mind-door as a dream. </p>

<p><a name='8-314' href='?#8-314'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-315' href='?#8-315'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-316' href='?#8-316'>&nbsp;</a>59. Taking one of the aforesaid objects, a thought-process runs its course 
even if the death be an instantaneous one. It is said that even the fly which is 
crushed by a hammer on the anvil also experiences such a thought-process before 
it actually dies. </p>

<p><a name='8-317' href='?#8-317'>&nbsp;</a>Let us imagine for the sake of convenience that the dying person is to be 
reborn in the human plane and that his object is some good Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-318' href='?#8-318'>&nbsp;</a>His <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness, interrupted, vibrates for one 
thought-moment and passes away. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending 
consciousness <i>(manodvārāvajjana)</i>
arises and passes away. Then comes the psychologically important stage - the <i>
javana</i>
process - which here runs only for five thought-moments by reason of its 
weakness, instead of the normal seven. As such it lacks all reproductive power; 
its main function being the mere regulation of the new existence - <i>
abhinavakarana.</i> The object in the present case being desirable, the 
consciousness he experiences is a moral one - automatic or prompted, accompanied 
by pleasure, and associated with wisdom or as the case may be. The <i>
tadālambana</i>
consciousness which has for its function a registering or identifying for two 
moments of the object so perceived, may or may not follow. After this occurs 
death consciousness <i>(cuti citta), </i>the last thought-moment to be 
experienced in this present life. (See Diagram XI). </p>

<p><a name='8-319' href='?#8-319'>&nbsp;</a>There is a misconception amongst some that the subsequent birth is 
conditioned by this last decease-thought. What actually conditions rebirth is 
not this decease-thought, which in itself has no special function to perform, 
but that which is experienced during the <i>javana</i> process. </p>

<p><a name='8-320' href='?#8-320'>&nbsp;</a>With the ceasing of the decease-consciousness death actually occurs. Then no 
material qualities born of mind and food <i>(cittaja</i> and <i>āhāraja rūpa)</i>
are produced. Only series of material qualities born of heat <i>(utuja)</i> goes 
on till the corpse is reduced to dust. </p>

<p><a name='8-321' href='?#8-321'>&nbsp;</a>Now, immediately after the dissolution of the decease consciousness <i>(cuti 
citta)</i> there arises in a fresh existence the re-linking consciousness <i>
(patisandhi viññāna).</i> This is followed by sixteen <i>bhavanga</i> 
thought-moments. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending consciousness <i>
(manodvārāvajjana)</i> arises, to be followed by seven <i>javana</i> 
thought-moments, developing a liking to the fresh existence <i>(bhavanikanti 
javana). </i>Then the <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness arises and perishes, and the 
stream of consciousness flows on ceaselessly (see Diagram XII). </p>

<p><a name='8-322' href='?#8-322'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-323' href='?#8-323'>&nbsp;</a>60. In the case of Formless Realms there is no heart-base <i>(hadayavatthu).</i></p>

a stream (62), until the arising of the decease-consciousness (63). Being an 
essential factor of life, this consciousness is known as <i>bhavanga.</i> At the

<p><a name='8-340' href='?#8-340'>&nbsp;</a>61. <i>Patisandhi, bhavanga,</i> and <i>cuti</i> consciousness of one 
particular existence are identical as they have the same object. The mental 
states in each of these three are the same. They differ only in name and in 
function. Immediately after the rebirth-consciousness <i>bhavanga</i>-consciousness 
arises. During lifetime, whenever no thought-processes arise, this <i>bhavanga</i> 
consciousness exists. One experiences innumerable <i>bhavanga</i>
