<p>Five Sense-Door Thought-process</b></font></p>
<b>

<p>Introductory</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. Having thus completed the noble compendium of consciousness and its 
concomitants (with respect to feelings etc.), I shall briefly describe, in due 
order, the compendium of (thought) processes in lifetime, according to the 
planes and individuals, and as they are determined by what (consciousness) that 
precedes and by what that follows (1) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. In the preceding chapter states of consciousness and mental concomitants 
were treated according to feelings, roots, etc. In the present one the author 
deals with thought processes as they arise through the mind and the other five 
senses, in accordance with the different kinds of individuals and planes of 
existence. </p>

<p>The Pāli phrase <i>pubbāparaniyāmitam</i> needs an explanation. The 
commentary explains it thus - this <i>citta</i> arises after so many <i>cittas,</i> 
and so many <i>cittas</i> follow this <i>citta (idam ettakehi param, imassa 
anantaram, ettakāni cittāni). </i></p>

<p><i>Patisandhi</i> here refers to the initial thought-process that occurs at 
the moment of conception in a new birth. <i>Pavatti</i> refers to all 
thought-processes that occur during the course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p>The translation of these two verses appears in the Compendium of Philosophy 
as follows:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;This further summary of geneses</p>
    <p>Of thought now having made, I will go on </p>
    <p>To speak concisely, summing up again </p>
    <p>Processes of the mind, in birth and life, </p>
    <p>By order due, the &#39;after,&#39; the &#39;before,&#39; </p>
    <p>Distinguishing both person and life-plane.&#39; (p. 124).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>Thought-Processes</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 2. In the compendium of thought-processes six kinds of six classes each 
should be understood - namely, </p>

<p>i. six bases, ii. six doors, iii. six objects*, iv. six-fold consciousness, 
v. six processes (2), and vi. sixfold presentation of objects (3) </p>

<p>The presentation of objects to the process-freed consciousness** is threefold 
- namely, (i) Kamma, (ii) Kamma sign, and (iii) Destiny sign. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[* These first three classes have already been discused in the previous 
chapter. They are repeated hero merely to complete the six groups.]</p>

<p>[** Namely, <i>patisandhi, bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti.</i>]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bases, doors, and objects, therein, are as described before. </p>

<p>The sixfold types of consciousness are eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, 
nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and 
mind-consciousness. </p>

<p>According to the doors the thought-processes are:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The process connected with the eye-door, </p>
    <p>2. The process connected with the ear-door, </p>
    <p>3. The process connected with the nose-door, </p>
    <p>4. The process connected with the tongue-door, </p>
    <p>5. The process connected with the body-door, and </p>
    <p>6. The process connected with the mind-door. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to consciousness the thought-processes are: -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The process connected with the eye-consciousness </p>

<p>2. The process connected with the ear-consciousness </p>

<p>3. The process connected with the nose consciousness,</p>

<p>4. The process connected with the tongue-consciousness,</p>

<p>5. The process connected with the body-consciousness, and </p>

<p>6. The process connected with the mind consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The thought-procedure connected with the doors should thus be co-ordinated. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. The sixfold presentation of objects (4) should be understood as 
follows:-</p>

<p>a. At the five sense doors -</p>

<p>(i) &#39;very great,&#39; (ii) &#39;great,&#39; (iii) &#39;slight,&#39; (iv) &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p>b. At the mind door -</p>

<p>(v) &#39;clear&#39; and (vi) &#39;obscure.&#39; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How is the intensity of objects be determined? </p>

<p>The three instants such as genesis, static (or development), and dissolution 
constitute one thought-moment. The duration of material things consists of 
seventeen such thought-moments. </p>

<p>The five sense-objects enter the avenue of five sense doors at the static 
stage when one or several thought moments have passed. </p>

<p>Hence the thought-process (4) runs as follows: -</p>

<p>Suppose a visible object which has passed one instant (i) enters the avenue 
of eye. Then the <i>bhavanga-</i>consciousness vibrates for one moment and 
perishes, (ii, iii) arresting the <i>bhavanga</i> stream. Subsequently the 
five-door apprehending consciousness (iv) arises and ceases apprehending that 
very visible object. </p>

<p>Thereafter the following thought-moments arise and cease in order -</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(v) eye-consciousness seeing that very form,</p>
        <p>(vi) recipient consciousness receiving it,</p>
        <p>(vii) investigating consciousness investigating it, </p>
        <p>(viii) determining consciousness determining it. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then any one of the 29 kinds of sense-sphere <i>javanas</i>, thus causally 
conditioned, runs mostly for seven moments (ix - xv).</p>

<p>Following the javanas two retentive resultants (xvi, xvii) arise accordingly. 
Finally comes the subsidence into the <i>bhavanga</i>. </p>

<p>Thus far seventeen thought-moments are complete, namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>fourteen &#39;thought-arisings&#39; <i>(cittuppāda) </p>
        </i><p>two vibrations of <i>bhavanga,</i> and </p>
        <p>one thought-moment that passed at t he inception.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the object ceases. </p>

<p>Such an object is termed &#39;very great.&#39; (<font SIZE="2">See pp. 231, 232.)</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That object which enters the avenue of sense, having passed (a few moments) 
and is not able to survive till the arising of the retentive thought-moments, is 
termed &#39;great. &#39; </p>

<p>That object which enters the avenue of sense, having passed (a few moments) 
and is not able to survive even till - the arising of the javanas, is termed 
&#39;slight.&#39;</p>

<p>In that case even the javanas do not arise, but only the determining 
consciousness lasts for two or three moments and then there is subsidence into 
bhavanga.</p>

<p>That object which is about to cease and which enters the avenue of sense, 
having passed a few moments and is not able to survive till the arising of 
determining consciousness, is termed &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p>In that case there is merely a vibration of the <i>bhavanga,</i> but no 
genesis of a thought-process.</p>

<p>As the eye-door so is in the ear-door etc. </p>

<p>In all the five doors, the fourfold presentation of objects should be 
understood, in due order, in the four ways, known as -</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. the course (ending with) retention.</p>
    <p>2. the course (ending with) javana. </p>
    <p>3. the course (ending with) determining, and</p>
    <p>4. the futile course. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>§ 4. There are seven modes* and fourteen different types of consciousness in 
the thought-process. In detail there are accordingly 54** in the five doors. </p>

<p>Herein this is the method of thought-process in the five sense-doors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[* Namely, 1. <i>āvajjana,</i> 2. <i>pañca viññāna,</i> 3. <i>sampaticchana,</i>
4. <i>santīrana,</i> 5. <i>votthapana,</i> 6. <i>javana,</i> (7 moments) and 7. <i>
tadālambana.</i>
These become 14 when the 7 <i>javana</i> moments and 2 <i>tadālambanas</i> are 
reckoned separately.]</font></p>

<p>[** <font SIZE="2">These comprise all the classes of Sense-sphere 
consciousness which arise through the five sense-doors.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: - </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2. Vīthi</b> is derived from <i>vi +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>i,</i> to go. </p>

<p>This term means a way or street, but here it is used in the sense of process <i>
(paramparā).</i> A thought-process consists of several thought-moments, and a 
thought-moment is never called a <i>citta-vīthi.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>3. Visayappavatti -</b></p>

<p>The commentarial explanation is - &#39;the presentation of objects at the doors,&#39; 
or &#39;the genesis of consciousness on the presentation of such objects.&#39; <i>
(visayānam dvāresu, visayesu ca cittānam pavatti). </i></p>

<p>The author evidently prefers the first explanation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>4. Thought-processes </b></p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma ordinarily there is no moment when we do not 
experience a particular kind of consciousness, hanging on to some object - 
whether physical of mental. The time-limit of such a consciousness is termed one 
thought-moment. The rapidity of the succession of such thought-moments is hardly 
conceivable by the ken of human knowledge. Books state that within the brief 
duration of a flash of lightning, or in the twinkling of an eye billions of 
thought-moments may arise and perish. </p>

<p>Each thought-moment consists of three minor instants <i>(khanas).</i>
They are <i>uppāda</i> (arising or genesis), <i>thiti</i> (static or 
development), and <i>bhanga</i>
(cessation or dissolution). </p>

<p>Birth, decay, and death* correspond to these three states. The interval 
between birth and death is regarded as decay. </p>

<p>Immediately after the cessation stage of a thought-moment there results the 
genesis stage of the subsequent thought-moment. Thus each unit of consciousness 
perishes conditioning another, transmitting at the same time all its 
potentialities to its successor. There is, therefore, a continuous flow of 
consciousness like a stream without any interruption. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[*<font SIZE="2">These three stages correspond to the Hindu view of Brahma 
(Creator). Vishnu (Preserver) and Siva (Destroyer).]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a material object is presented to the mind through one of the five 
sense-doors, a thought-process occurs, consisting of a series of separate 
thought-moments leading one to the other in a particular, uniform order. This 
order is known as the <i>citta-niyāma</i>
(psychic order). As a rule for a complete perception of a physical object 
through one of the sense-doors precisely 17 thought-moments must pass. As such 
the time duration of matter is fixed at 17 thought-moments. After the expiration 
of that time-limit, one fundamental unit of matter perishes giving birth to 
another unit. The first moment is regarded as the genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> the 
last as dissolution <i>(bhanga),</i> and the interval 15 moments as decay or 
development <i>(thiti</i> or<i> jarā). </i></p>

<p>As a rule when an object enters the consciousness through any of the doors 
one moment of the life-continuum elapses. This is known as <i>atīta-bhavanga.</i>
Then the corresponding thought-process runs uninterruptedly for 16 
thought-moments. The object thus presented is regarded as &#39;very great.&#39; </p>

<p>If the thought-process ceases at the expiration of <i>javanas</i>
without giving rise to two retentive moments <i>(tadālambana), </i>thus 
completing only 14 moments, then the object is called &#39;great&#39;. </p>

<p>Sometimes the thought-process ceases at the moment of determining <i>
(votthapana)</i>
without giving rise to the <i>javanas,</i> completing only 7 thought-moments 
Then the object is termed &#39;slight.&#39; </p>

<p>At times when an object enters the consciousness there is merely a vibration 
of the life-continuum. Then the object is termed &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p>When a so-called &#39;very great&#39; or &#39;great&#39; object perceived through the five 
sense-doors, is subsequently conceived by the mind-door, or when a thought 
process arising through the mind-door extends up to the retentive stage, then 
the object is regarded as &#39;clear&#39;.</p>

<p>When a thought process, arising through the mind-door, ceases at the javana 
stage, the object is termed &#39;obscure&#39;. </p>

<p>When, for instance, a person looks at the radiant moon on a cloudless night, 
he gets a faint glimpse of the surrounding stars as well. He focuses his 
attention on the moon, but he cannot avoid the sight of stars around. The moon 
is regarded as a great object, while the stars are regarded as minor objects. 
Both moon and stars are perceived by the mind at different moments. According to 
Abhidhamma it is not correct to say that the stars are perceived by the 
sub-consciousness and the moon by the consciousness. </p>

be any one of the javanas amongst the 26 Sublime and Supramundane classes, 
descends into ecstatic process, in accordance with the appropriate effort.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, immediately after a pleasurable <i>javana,</i> a pleasurable ecstatic <i>

an ecstatic <i>javana,</i> accompanied by equanimity, is to be expected. </p>

<p>Here, too, a moral <i>javana,</i> is followed by a moral <i>javana</i>
and (in the case of attainment - <i>samāpatti)</i> it gives rise to three lower 
Fruits. </p>

<p>A functional <i>javana</i> is followed by a functional <i>javana</i>
and the Fruit of Arahatship. </p>

<p>§ 8. After <i>(tihetuka)</i> (6) pleasurable meritorious thoughts (7) arise 
32 (classes of consciousness) (8); after <i>(tihetuka)</i> meritorious thoughts, 
accompanied by equanimity, 12 classes of consciousness (9); after <i>(tihetuka)</i>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5. Appanā </b>- (Sanskrit - <i>arpanā,</i> derived from <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>ri,</i> to go). </p>

<p>This is a rare Pāli term found in Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>It is derived from the root <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>i,</i> to go </p>

<p>&#39;<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>I</i> + the causal suffix; <i>&#39;āpe&#39; + ana.</i> <i>
&#39;A&#39;</i> is substituted for <i>&#39;i&#39;</i>, and <i>&#39;p&#39;</i> is duplicated; <i>&#39;A&#39; + 
ppe + ana = appanā.</i> The initial <i>&#39;ā&#39;</i> is shortened before double <i>
&#39;p&#39;.</i> </p>

<p>Venerable Buddhaghosa defines <i>&#39;appanā&#39;</i> as the directing or fixing of 
the one-pointed consciousness on an object <i>(ekaggam cittam ārammane appenti). </i></p>

<p>Appanā is a highly developed form of <i>vitakka</i> - initial application of 
the mind, one of the <i>jhāna</i> factors. </p>

<p>The aspirant who wishes to develop <i>jhānas</i> takes for his object a 
suitable subject, according to his temperament. In the course of his 
meditations, as mentioned in the first chapter, he arrives at a stage when he 
would be able to experience the first jhānic ecstasy. </p>

<p>Then a thought-process runs as follows -</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>manodvārāvajjana - parikamma - upacāra - anuloma - gotrabhū - appanā</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is the mind-door consciousness, which precedes the <i>javana</i>
stage, conditioned by objects that enter the avenue of consciousness. </p>

<p>The initial thought-moment of the <i>appanā javana</i>-process is termed <i>
parikamma</i> because it is a preparation for the desired higher consciousness 
whether Sublime <i>(mahaggata)</i> or Supramundane <i>(lokuttara).</i> This is 
followed by another thought-moment known as <i>upacāra</i> because it arises in 
proximity to the higher consciousness. Ordinarily these two thought-moments 
arise at the beginning of the <i>appanā javana</i>-process, but if the person is 
morally advanced only <i>upacāra</i> moment arises without the initial <i>
parikamma</i> moment. </p>

<p>The third thought-moment is known as <i>anuloma</i> because it arises in 
harmony with the preceding thought moments and the following <i>gotrabhū</i> 
thought moment. <i>Gotrabhū,</i> literally, means that which overcomes the 
Sense-sphere lineage or that which develops the sublime or exalted lineage. 
Immediately after this <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment arises the <i>appanā</i> <i>jhāna</i> thought-moment. Absolute 
one-pointedness of the mind is gained at this advanced stage of mental 
development. </p>

<p>The fully undeveloped <i>jhāna,</i> present in the preliminary 
thought-moments, is known as <i>upacāra samādhi,</i> access concentration. </p>

<p>To a worldling and a <i>Sekha</i> one of the four <i>kāmāvacara</i>
moral <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by knowledge, arises as these preliminary <i>
appanā</i>
thought-moments. In the case of an <i>Asekha</i> it is one of the four <i>
kāmāvacara</i>
functional <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by knowledge. </p>

<p><a NAME="page218"></a>The Supramundane <i>appanā javana</i>-process occurs as 
follows -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<i>

<table border="1" width="67%">

    <td width="15%">phala</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></p>

<p>In this thought-process <i>parikamma</i> may or may not precede. As stated 
above it depends on the moral advancement of the person. Here <i>gotrabhū</i>
means that which overcomes the lineage of the worldling or that which develops 
the supramundane lineage. </p>

<p>One of the four <i>kāmāvacara</i> moral <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by 
knowledge, arises in these preliminary stages. The object of the first three 
thought-moments is mundane but the object of the <i>gotrabhū</i> is supramundane 
Nibbāna. Nevertheless, this developed thought-moment is incapable of eradicating 
the innate defilements. It is the <i>magga</i> (Path) consciousness that 
immediately follows, which performs the double function of intuiting Nibbāna and 
of eradicating the defilements. It should be noted that the Path consciousness 
occurs only once. This is immediately followed by two moments of <i>phala</i> 
(Fruit) consciousness if <i>parikamma</i>
is present. Otherwise there will be three <i>phala</i> thought-moments. </p>

<p>In the case of the second, third, fourth, stages of Sainthood-the fourth 
thought-moment is named <i>vodāna,</i> which means purification, instead of <i>
gotrabhū.</i>
If the <i>parikamma</i> thought-moment precedes, <i>vodāna</i> thought-moment 
arises as the fourth, otherwise as the third. </p>

<p>Each of the four Supramundane Paths arises only once in the course of one&#39;s 
life. But one may experience the Fruit consciousness even for a whole day 
continuously. The three lower fruits, Sotāpatti, Sakadāgāmi, and Anāgāmi are 
preceded by a moral <i>javana.</i> When one enjoys the Fruit of Arahatship the <i>
javanas</i> that immediately precede must be functionals because an Arahat, 
being an <i>Asekha</i> does not experience moral <i>javanas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <i>Tihetuka</i> - conditioned by three <i>hetus - alobha</i>
(generosity), <i>adosa</i> (goodwill) and <i>amoha</i> (wisdom) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. Viz., two types of <i>kāmāvacara</i> consciousness, accompanied by 
pleasure and knowledge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. Namely, the first 4 <i>rūpa jhānas</i> and 28 (7x4) <i>lokuttara jhānas.</i> 
The Arahat Fruit and functionals are excluded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. Namely, 1, 5th <i>rūpa jhāna</i> + 4 <i>arūpa jhānas</i> + 7 <i>lokuttara

<p>The Procedure of Retention </b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 9. Here, under all circumstances (i.e., in both sense-door and mind-door) 
when an object (12) is undesirable, the five sense-impressions, reception, 
investigation, retention (that arise) are immoral resultants. If desirable, they 
are moral resultants. If the object is extremely desirable, investigation and 
retention are accompanied by pleasure.</p>

<p>In this connection, at the end of functional javanas accompanied by pleasure, 
there arise retentive thought-moments also accompanied by pleasure. At the end 
of functional <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by equanimity, the retentive thought 
moments are also accompanied by equanimity. </p>

<p>But at the end of javanas, accompanied by displeasure, the retentive thought- 
moments and the <i>bhavangas</i> are also accompanied by indifference. Hence to 
one whose rebirth-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure, if, at the end of 
javanas, accompanied by displeasure, retentive thought-moments do not arise, 
then, there arises an investigating consciousness accompanied by indifference, 
hanging on to some sense-object with which one is familiar before. Immediately 
after, the teachers say there is subsidence into the life-continuum.</p>

<p>Likewise they expect retention at the end of Sense-sphere <i>javanas</i>
to the Sense-sphere beings, only when Sense-sphere phenomena become objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 10. Retention occurs, they say, in connection with &#39;clear&#39; and &#39;very great&#39; 
objects when there is certainty as regards the Sense-sphere javanas, beings, and 
objects. </p>

<p>Herein this is the procedure of retention. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>
<b>

<p>12. Objects - ārammana</b></p>

<p>The desirability or undesirability of an object is determined not according 
to individual temperament, but according to its intrinsic nature. The resultant 
consciousness conditioned thereby is regarded as the effect of one&#39;s good or bad 
action. </p>

<p>The sight of the Buddha will perhaps be repulsive to a staunch heretic. His <i>
javana</i> thoughts will naturally be unwholesome. But the passive wholesome 
resultant eye-consciousness, caused by a past good kamma, is a <i>kusala vipāka.</i> 
This
<i>vipāka</i> is not conditioned by his will, but is an inevitable consequence. 
The <i>javana</i>
process, on the contrary, is conditioned by his own will. </p>

<p>Again, for instance, the mere sight of excreta will be a source of delight to 
an ordinary dog. The object is generally undesirable and is a bad effect <i>
(akusala vipāka), </i>but the <i>javana</i> process caused thereby will be 
wholesome to the dog. The accompanying feeling will also be pleasurable. </p>

<p>Although even an Arahat experiences an <i>akusala vipāka</i> at the sight of 
an undesirable object, his <i>javana</i> process will neither be wholesome nor 
unwholesome. The accompanying feeling will be one of equanimity. </p>

<p>Now, when an undesirable object is presented either through the mind-door or 
five sense-doors, the sense-impressions, reception, investigation, retention 
that occur in the respective thought-processes, are all bad effects <i>(akusala 
vipākas).</i>
The accompanying feeling is invariably <i>upekkhā,</i> except in the case of 
body-impression which is <i>dukkha.</i> These thought-moments are the inevitable 
results of past bad actions. </p>

<p>If the presented object is desirable, then the afore-said thought-moments are 
all good effects<i> (kusala vipākas). </i>Here too the accompanying feeling is <i>
upekkhā,</i> except in the case of body-impression which is <i>sukha.</i>
All these thought-moments are the results of past good actions. </p>

<p>When the object is extremely desirable, the feeling of the <i>santīrana</i>
moment differs. Instead of <i>upekkhā</i> it is <i>somanassa. </i></p>

<p>The <i>tadārammanas</i> followed by Sense sphere functional <i>javanas,</i>
accompanied by pleasure, are also associated with a similar feeling. Likewise 
the <i>upekkhā javanas</i> are followed by <i>upekkhā tadārammanas.</i></p>

<p>As a rule the preceding <i>javanas</i> and the subsequent <i>tadārammanas</i>
possess a similar feeling. Somanassa is followed by <i>somanassa,</i> and <i>
upekkhā</i>
by <i>upekkhā.</i> </p>

<p>What happens when the javanas are accompanied by domanassa as there are no <i>
domanassa tadārammanas? </i></p>

<p>If the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta) </i>of the person is 
accompanied by <i>somanassa,</i> then when <i>javanas</i> are accompanied by <i>
domanassa,</i>
the <i>tadārammanas,</i> if they occur, will be accompanied by equanimity <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata),
</i>but if <i>tadārammanas</i> do not occur, then an adventitious <i>upekkhā</i> <i>
santīrana,</i>
without any special function, will intervene for one moment. This adventitious 
thought-moment is technically termed <i>āgantukabhavanga.</i> Usually the object 
of the <i>javanas</i>
and that of the <i>tadārammanas</i> are identical. But in this particular case 
the objects differ. The object of this <i>santīrana</i> is another <i>kāmāvacara</i> 
object with which one is familiar in the course of one&#39;s life. This object is 
termed <i>paritta</i>
(smaller or lesser) in comparison with the higher <i>rūpa, arūpa</i> and <i>
lokuttara</i>
objects. </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the rebirth-consciousness is not associated with
<i>somanassa,</i> then the <i>tadārammanas</i> therein become <i>upekhā</i> as 
are the <i>bhavangas</i>
that follow. </p>

<p>It should be noted that <i>tadārammanas</i> occur only at the end of <i>
kāmāvacara</i>
<i>javanas,</i> only to <i>kāmāvacara</i> beings, and only in connection with <i>
kāmāvacara</i>
objects, which are either &#39;very intense&#39; or &#39;clear.&#39; </p>

<p>Procedure of Javana (13)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 11. Amongst the <i>javanas,</i> in a minor process, the sense-sphere
<i>javanas</i> run only for seven or six times. </p>

<p>But in the case of a feeble process and at the time of dying, etc., only five 
times. </p>

<p>To the Exalted One, at the time of the &#39;Twin Psychic Phenomenon&#39; and the 
like, when the procedure is alert, only four or five reflective thought-moments 
arise, they say. </p>

<p>To the beginner, during the first ecstasy, the Sublime <i>javanas</i>
and super-intellect <i>javanas</i> run only once at all times. Subsequently 
there is subsidence into the life-continuum. </p>

<p>The arising of the four Paths endures for only one thought-moment. Thereafter 
two or three Fruit thought-moments arise accordingly. Then comes subsidence into 
life-continuum . </p>

<p>At the time of Supreme Cessation (14) the fourth <i>arūpa javana</i>
runs twice and then contacts Cessation. When emerging (from this ecstasy) either 
Anāgāmi Fruit-consciousness or Arahatta Fruit-consciousness arises accordingly. 
When it ceases there is subsidence into the life-continuum . </p>

<p>In the process of Attainments there is no regularity of thought-processes, as 
in the stream of the life-continuum. Nevertheless, it should be understood that 
many (Sublime and Supramundane) <i>javanas</i> take place. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 12. It should be known that minor <i>javanas</i> arise seven times, the 
Path and Super-intellect only once, the rest (Sublime and Supramundane) several 
times.
</p>

<p>Herein this is the procedure of <i>javanas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>
<b>

<p>13. Javana -</b></p>

<p>As it is difficult to give an adequate English rendering for <i>javana,</i>
the Pāli term has been retained here. </p>

<p>Both psychologically and ethically <i>javana</i> thought-moments are the most 
important, as both good and evil are determined at this stage. </p>

<p>Sometimes the <i>javanas</i> last only for one moment. At times they may 
continue for seven moments at the most. </p>

<p><i>Kāmāvacara javanas,</i> as a rule, last only for six or seven moments. 
When one is in a senseless state or is about to die, <i>javanas</i> are confined 
to five moments. </p>

<p>When the Buddha, by His psychic powers, emits fire and water, almost 
simultaneously, from His body, only four or five <i>javana</i> thought-moments 
arise so as to reflect on the <i>jhāna</i> factors, which is a prerequisite, for 
the performance of this &#39;Twin Psychic Phenomenon&#39;. </p>

<p>In the case of a yogi who develops the first <i>jhāna</i> for the first time, <i>
javana</i> lasts only for one moment. So is it with those who develop the five <i>
abhiññās</i> - namely, i. Psychic Powers <i>(Iddhividha),</i> ii. Celestial Ear
<i>(Dibba Sota),</i> iii. Celestial Eye <i>(Dibba Cakkhu),</i> iv. Reading of 
Others&#39; Thoughts <i>(Paracittavijānana),</i> and v. Reminiscence of Previous 
Births <i>(Pubbe-nivāsānussati ñāna). </i>The four classes of supramundane <i>
javana</i> Path-consciousness also last for one moment only. It is at this great 
moment that Nibbāna is intuited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>14. Nirodha Samāpatti -</b></p>

<p>An Anāgāmi or an Arahat, who has developed the <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa 
jhānas,</i> could, by will-power, temporarily arrest the ordinary flow of 
consciousness even for seven days continuously. When one attains this state, all 
mental activities cease, although there exist heat and life devoid of any 
breathing. The difference between a corpse and one in this state, is that the 
latter possesses life. Books state too that his body cannot be harmed. The 
attainment of such an ecstatic state is known as <i>nirodha</i>
<i>samāpatti. Nirodha</i> means cessation, and <i>samāpatti</i> is attainment. </p>

<p>Immediately prior to the attainment of this state he experiences for two 
moments the fourth <i>arūpa jhāna</i> (state of neither perception nor 
non-perception). The flow of consciousness then ceases until he emerges 
therefrom as determined by him. As a rule he remains in this state for about a 
week. Motionless he abides in this ecstasy. Books relate an incident of a 
Pacceka Buddha whose body was set fire to while in this state. But he was not 
affected thereby. </p>

<p>Now when he emerges from this state the first thought-moment to arise is an 
Anāgāmi Fruit-consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat 
Fruit-consciousness in the case of an Arahat. Thereafter the stream of 
consciousness subsides into bhavanga.</p>

<p>Classification of Individuals</b></font></p>

<p>§ 13. Herein, to those whose rebirth-consciousness is conditioned by two 
roots (<font SIZE="2"><i>alobha</i> and <i>adosa)</i></font> and conditioned by 
none, functional javanas and ecstatic javanas (*1) do not arise. Likewise, in a 
happy plane, resultants, accompanied by knowledge, also do not arise (*2). But 
in a woeful state they do not also get great resultants dissociated with 
knowledge </p>

<p>To the Corruption-freed (Arahats) amongst those whose rebirth-consciousness 
is conditioned by three roots, no moral nor immoral <i>javanas</i>
arise. Similarly to the Sekhas and worldlings functional <i>javanas</i> do not 
arise. Nor do the <i>javanas</i> connected with misbelief and doubts arise to 
the Sekhas.(*3) To the Anāgāmi individuals there are no <i>javanas</i> connected 
with aversion. (*4) But the supramundane <i>javanas</i> are experienced only by 
Ariyas (*5) according to their respective capacities. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 14. As they arise it is stated that Asekhas experience 44 (*6), Sekhas 56

<p>§ 15. In the Sense sphere all these foregoing thought-processes occur 
according to circumstances. </p>

<p>On the Plane of Form (all) with the exception of <i>javanas</i>
connected with aversion and retentive moments. </p>

<p>On the Formless Plane (all) with the exception of the First Path, <i>
rūpāvacara</i>
consciousness, smiling consciousness, and the lower <i>arūpa</i> classes of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>In all planes, to those who are devoid of sense-organs, thought-processes 
connected with corresponding doors do not arise. </p>

<p>To those individuals without consciousness there is absolutely no mental 
process whatsoever. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 16. In the sense-sphere, according to circumstances, 80 (*1) 
thought-processes are obtained, on the Plane of Form 64 (*2), on the Formless 
Plane 42 (*3). </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Planes. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 17. Thus the thought-processes connected with six doors, as they arise, 
continue without any break, intercepted by <i>bavangas</i>, while life lasts. </p>

<p>Thus ends the fourty chapter in the Compendium of Abhidhamma, entitled the 
Analysis of Thought-processes. </p>

<p>Thought-Processes</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When, for instance, a visible object enters the mind through the eye-door, a 
thought-process runs as follows - </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Pañcadvāra citta vīthi - Ati Mahanta</b><i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 atīta bhavanga </p>
  <p>2 bhavanga calana </p>
  <p>3 bhavañgupaccheda</p>
  <p>4 pañcadvārāvajjana </p>
  <p>5 cakkhu viññāna</p>
  <p>6 sampaticchana</p>
  <p>7 santīrana</p>
  <p>8 votthapana</p>
  <p>9 - 15 javana</p>
  <p>16 - 17 tadārammana</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>

<p>Immediately after this five sense-door thought-process, the stream of 
consciousness subsides into <i>bhavanga</i>. Then there arises a mind-door 
thought-process perceiving the aforesaid visible object mentally as follows -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Manodvārika Vīthi</b></p>

<table border="1" width="311">
  <tr>
    <td width="108"><p><i>1</i></td>
    <td width="191"><p><i>manodvārāvajjana</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="108"><p><i>2 - 8 </i></td>
    <td width="191"><p><i>javana</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="108"><p><i>9 - 10</i></td>
    <td width="191"><p><i>tadārammana</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Again the stream of consciousness subsides into <em>bhavanga</em>, and two 
more similar thought-processes arise before the object is actually known. </p>
