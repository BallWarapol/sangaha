<p>The Compendium of Relations</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial"><b></p>

<p>Introductory verse</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. I shall now explain here, in a fitting manner, how causal states act as 
relations to the conditioned states (1). </p>

<p>§ 2. The compendium of relations is twofold: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A. The Law of Dependent Arising (2), and </p>

<p>B. The Law of Causal Relations (3). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of these, the Law of Dependent Arising is marked by the simple happening of a 
state dependent on its antecedent state (4). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Law of Causal Relations is said with reference to the existence of 
conditions that relate to one another. </p>

<p>Teachers explain them by mixing both methods. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial"><b></p>

<p>The Law of Dependent Arising</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therein: </p>

<p>Dependent on Ignorance (5 ) arise Conditioning Activities (6). </p>

<p>Dependent on Conditioning Activities arises (Rebirth) Consciousness (7). </p>

<p>Dependent on (Rebirth) Consciousness arise Mind and Matter (8). </p>

<p>Dependent on Mind and Matter arise the six (Sense) Bases (9).</p>

<p>Dependent on the six (sense) Bases arises contact (10).</p>

<p>Dependent on Contact arises Feeling (11). </p>

<p>Dependent on Feeling arises Craving (12). </p>

<p>Dependent on Craving arises Grasping (13). </p>

<p>Dependent on Grasping arises Action or Becoming (14)</p>

<p>Dependent on Action arises Birth (15). </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dependent on Birth arise Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief, 
	and Despair. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus arises the whole mass of suffering. </p>

<p>Herein this is the Law of the Dependent Arising. </p>

<p>It should be understood that there are three periods twelve factors, twenty 
modes, three connections, four divisions, three rounds, and two roots. </p>

<p>How ? </p>

<p>Ignorance and Conditioning Activities belong to the past; Birth, Decay, Death 
belong to the future; the intermediate eight to the present. Thus there are 
three periods. </p>

<p>Ignorance, (moral and immoral) Activities, (Rebirth) Consciousness, Mind and 
Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, Feeling, Craving, Grasping, Action, Birth, 
Decay and Death are the twelve factors. The terms Sorrow and so on are shown as 
incidental consequences (of Birth). </p>

<p>Here, by taking ignorance and activities, craving, grasping, and action are 
also taken. Likewise, by taking craving, grasping, and action, ignorance and 
activities are also taken. By taking birth, decay and death, the five effects 
with consciousness and so on are taken also. Thus there are: </p>

<p>Five causes pertaining to the past, and five effects to the present; five 
causes pertaining to the present, and five effects to the future. </p>

<p>There are twenty, modes, three connections and four divisions. </p>

<p>The three Rounds: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Ignorance, craving, and grasping belong to the Round of Passions; </p>
        <p>2. One part of becoming <i>(bhava)</i> known as action and (moral and 
		immoral) activities belongs to the Round of Kamma. </p>
        <p>3. One part of becoming known as renewed existence <i>(upapattibhava)</i>
        and the rest belong to the Round of Effects. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignorance and craving should be understood as the two roots (10) (see 
diagrams XVI and XVII).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the destruction of these roots does the Round cease. </p>

<p>The ignorance, originating from defilements (17), increases in the constantly 
oppressed who faint by decay and death. </p>

<p>The Great Sage has thus expounded this entangled, beginningless existence in 
the triple sphere as the &#39;Law of Dependent Arising&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Sankhatadhammānam</b> - To the conditioned <i>nāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i>
described in the previous chapters. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Paticcasamuppāda</b> - <i>Paticca</i> = because of, on account of; <i>
samuppāda</i> = arising, origination. Although the literal meaning of the term 
is &#39;arising because of&#39; or dependent arising or origination, it is applied to 
the whole causal formula which consists of twelve interdependent causes and 
effects, technically called <i>paccaya</i> and <i>paccayuppanna. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </i><p>S. Z. Aung renders <i>paticcasamuppādanaya</i> by &#39;The Law of 
	  happening by way of cause&#39;. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In this chapter the Law of Dependent Arising is not mixed up with the 
Patthānanaya as in the Visuddhi-Magga. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Patthānanaya</b> - According to the Ceylon Commentary here the prefix <i>
&#39;pa&#39;</i> means &#39;various&#39; <i>(nānappakāra).</i> Ledi Sayadaw says &#39;principal&#39; <i>
(padhāna). Thāna</i> (lit. station) signifies &#39;cause&#39; <i>(paccaya)</i> which is 
paraphrased by <i>&#39;upakārakadhamma&#39;</i>
- aiding or supportive conditions. These various or principal causes are 
described in detail in the Patthānapakarana, the seventh book of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. The system expounded in this treatise is called Patthānanaya. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The difference between the two understood as follows: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Because of A arises B. Because of B arises C. When there is no A 
		there is no B. When there is no B there is no C. In other words &#39;this 
		being so, that is; this not being so, that is not&#39; <i>(imasmim sati, 
		idam hoti; imasmim asati, idam na hoti).</i>
        This is the <i>paticcasamuppādanaya</i>. </p>
        <p>ii. When we say that A is related to B in the way of &#39;coexistence&#39;, 
		&#39;interdependence&#39;, we get an illustration of <i>patthānanaya.</i> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Tabbhāvabhāvībhāvākāramatta;</b> <i>bhāvākāramatta</i> = the simple 
happening of a state; <i>tabbhāvabhāvī</i> = dependent on its antecedent state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Avijjā,</b> lit., not-knowingness, i.e., of the four Noble Truths. It 
is also explained as &#39;that which causes beings to run in the endless Samsāra&#39; <i>
(antavirahite samsāre satte javāpeti).</i> &#39;Whereby the fruit is produced&#39; is 
termed <i>&#39;paccaya&#39;,</i>
which is the cause. When ignorance is destroyed and turned into knowingness, all 
causality is shattered as in the case of Buddhas and Arahats. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Sankhāra</b> - This is a multisignificant term which should be 
understood according to the context. Here the term signifies immoral <i>
(akusala), </i>moral
<i>(kusala),</i> and unshakable <i>(āneñjā)</i> volitions <i>(cetanā)</i> which 
constitute Kamma that produces rebirth. The first embraces all volitions in the 
12 types of immoral consciousness; the second, all volitions in the 8 types of 
Beautiful <i>(kusala)</i>
consciousness and the 5 types of <i>kusala rūpa-jhāna</i> consciousness; the 
third, all volitions in the 4 types of <i>kusala arūpa-jhānas.</i> Where is no 
proper English equivalent which gives the exact connotation of this Pāli term. <i>
Sankhārā,</i> as one of the five aggregates, implies the 50 mental states 
excluding feeling and perception. </p>

<p>The volitions of the four supramundane Path consciousnesses <i>
(lokuttara-magga-citta)</i>
are not regarded as <i>sankhārā</i> because they tend to eradicate ignorance. 
Wisdom <i>(paññā)</i>
is predominant in Supramundane types of consciousness, while volition <i>
(cetanā)</i> is predominant in the mundane types of consciousness. </p>

<p>Ignorance is predominant in immoral activities, while it is latent in moral 
activities. Hence both moral and immoral actions are regarded as caused by 
ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Viññāna</b> - strictly denotes the 19 types of rebirth-consciousness <i>
(patisandhi viññāna)</i> described in chapter V. All the 32 types of resultant 
consciousness<i> (vipāka-citta)</i> experienced during lifetime, are also 
implied by the term. </p>

<p>The foetus in the mother&#39;s womb is formed by the combination of this 
relinking-consciousness with the sperm and ovum cells of the parents. In this 
consciousness are latent all the past impressions, characteristics and 
tendencies of that particular individual life-flux. </p>

<p>This relinking-consciousness is regarded as &quot;radiant&quot; <i>(pabhassara)</i>
as it is either devoid of immoral roots of lust, hatred and delusion (as in the 
case of rootless resultants - <i>ahetuka-vipāka),</i> or accompanied by moral 
roots (as in the case of resultants with roots).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Nāma-rūpa</b> - This compound should be understood as <i>nāma</i>
alone, <i>rūpa</i> alone, and <i>nāmarūpa</i> together. In the case of <i>arūpa</i>
planes there arises only mind; in the case of mindless <i>(asañña)</i> planes, 
only matter; in the case of <i>kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i> planes, both mind and 
matter. </p>

<p>By <i>nāma</i> are here meant the three aggregates - feeling <i>(vedanā),</i>
perception <i>(saññā)</i> and <i>sankhārā</i> - that arise simultaneous with 
rebirth-consciousness. By <i>rūpa</i> are meant the three decads* <i>kāya,</i> <i>
bhāva-vatthu</i>
- that also arise simultaneous with rebirth-consciousness conditioned by past 
kamma. The second and third factors pertain to the past and present. The third 
and fourth factors, on the contrary, are contemporaneous. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>* The body decad <i>(kāyadasaka)</i> is composed of tbe four elements, 
namely, i. the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> ii. the element of 
cohesion <i>(āpo),</i>
iii. the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> iv. the element of motion <i>(vāyo);</i> 
its four derivatives <i>(upūdārūpa)</i> - namely, v. colour <i>(vanna),</i> vi. 
odour <i>(gandha),
</i>vii. taste <i>(rasa), </i>viii. nutritive essence <i>(oja),</i> with ix. 
vitality <i>(jīvitindriya),</i>
and x. body <i>(kāya).</i> </p>

<p>Sex-decad <i>(bhavadasaka)</i> and base-decad <i>(vatthudasaka) </i>also 
consist of the first nine and sex and seat of consciousness respectively. </p>

<p>From this it is evident that sex is determined by past Kamma at the very 
conception of the being. </p>

<p>Here <i>kāya</i> means the sensitive part of the body. Sex is not developed 
at the moment of conception but the potentiality is latent. Neither the heart 
nor the brain, the supposed seat of consciousness, is developed but the 
potentiality of the seat is latent.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Salāyatana</b> - During the embryonic period the six sense-bases 
gradually evolve from the psycho physical phenomena in which are latent infinite 
potentialities. The insignificant, infinitesimally small speck now develops into 
a complex six-sense-machine which now operates almost mechanically without any 
agent like a soul to act as the operator. The six sense-bases are eye, ear, 
nose, tongue, body, and mind. The first five refer to the sensitive organs that 
evolve by degrees. Mind-base has already been explained. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Phassa</b> - See Chapters 1 and 2. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Vedanā</b> - Ibid. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Tanhā</b> (Craving) is threefold, namely, craving for sensual 
pleasures <i>(kāma-tanhā),</i> craving for sensual pleasures associated with the 
view of eternalism <i>(bhava-tanhā)</i> i.e., enjoying, pleasures thinking that 
they are imperishable, and craving for sensual pleasures associated with the 
view of nihilism <i>(vibhava-tanhā)</i>
i.e., enjoying pleasures thinking that everything perishes after death. The last 
is the materialistic point of view. </p>

<p><i>Bhava-tanhā</i> and <i>vibhava-tanhā</i> are also interpreted as 
attachment to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> Planes respectively. Usually these 
two terms are rendered by craving for existence and non-existence. </p>

<p>There are six kinds of craving corresponding to the six sense-objects such as 
form, sound, and so on. They become 12 when they are treated as internal and 
external. They are reckoned as 36 when past, present and future are taken into 
consideration. When multiplied by the foregoing three kinds of craving they 
amount to 108.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Upādāna,</b> derived from <i>upa + ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
da,</i> to give, is intense craving or firm grasping. <i>Tanhā</i> is like 
groping in the dark to steal an object. <i>Upādāna</i> corresponds to the actual 
stealing. Grasping results with attachment and error. It gives rise to the false 
notions of &#39;I&#39; and &#39;mine&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Bhava,</b> lit., becoming, is explained as both moral and immoral 
action which constitute Kamma <i>(kamma-bhava)</i> - active process of becoming 
- and the different planes of existence <i>(upapattibhava)</i> - passive process 
of becoming. The only difference between <i>sankhāra</i> and <i>kammabhava</i> 
is that the former pertains to the past and the latter to the present. It is 
only the <i>(kamma) bhava
</i>that conditions the future birth. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Jāti,</b> strictly speaking, is the arising of the aggregates <i>
(khandhānam pātubhāvo).</i> Ignorance is shown as the past cause that conditions 
the present, and Craving as the present cause that conditions the future. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>āsavas</b> or Defilements, latent in all worldlings, are cited as the 
cause of ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Law of Casual Relations</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. The following are the causal relations: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Root (18) Condition</p>

<p>2. Object (19) &quot;</p>

<p>3. Predominance (20) &quot;</p>

<p>4. Contiguity (21) &quot;</p>

<p>5. Immediacy (21) &quot;</p>

<p>6. Conascence (22) &quot;</p>

<p>7. Mutuality (or Reciprocity) (23) &quot;</p>

<p>8. Dependence (24) &quot;</p>

<p>9. Powerful Dependence (or Sufficing) (24) &quot;</p>

<p>10. Pre-nascence (or Antecedence) (24) &quot;</p>

<p>11. Post-nascence (or Post occurrence) (26) &quot;</p>

<p>12. Repetition (or Habitual Recurrence) (27) &quot;</p>

<p>13. Kamma (28) &quot;</p>

<p>14. Effect (29) &quot;</p>

<p>15. Nutriment (30) &quot;</p>

<p>16. Control (31) &quot;</p>

<p>17. Jhāna (32) &quot;</p>

<p>18. Path (23) &quot;</p>

<p>19. Association (34) &quot;</p>

<p>20. Dissociation (36) &quot;</p>

<p>21. Presence (36) &quot;</p>

<p>22. Absence (37) &quot;</p>

<p>23. Separation (38) &quot;</p>

<p>24. Non-separation (38) &quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Herein this is the law of causal relations. </p>

<p>In six ways mind is related to mind. In five ways mind is related to mind and 
matter. Again mind is related in one way to matter, and matter in one way to 
mind. In two ways concepts, mind and matter are related to mind. In nine ways 
are the two - mind and matter - related to mind and matter. Thus the relations 
are sixfold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Relations of Mind and Matter</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. In six ways mind is related to mind: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consciousness and mental states that immediately cease, relate themselves to 
present consciousness and mental states by way of <b>contiguity</b>, <b>
immediacy</b>,
<b>absence</b> and <b>separation</b>. </p>

<p>Preceding Javanas are related to the subsequent, Javanas by way of <b>
repetition</b>
(or <b>habitual recurrence</b>). Coexisting consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another by way of <b>association</b>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. In five ways mind is related to mind and matter: </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Root, Jhāna</b> and <b>Path</b> factors are related to coexisting mind and 
matter by way of <b>root,</b> etc. </p>

<p>Coexisting volition is related to coexisting mind and matter and asynchronous 
volition to mind and matter born of Kamma by way of <b>Kamma</b>. </p>

<p>The (mental) aggregates of effect are related to one another and coexistent 
matter by way of <b>effect.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C. Only in one way is mind related to matter: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Subsequent consciousness and mental states are related to this preceding 
(material) body by way of <b>post-occurrence. </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>D. Only in one way is matter related to mind: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The six bases during life are related to the seven elements of cognition, and 
the five objects to the five processes of sense-cognition by way of <b>
antecedence.</b>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E. In two ways are concepts, mind and matter related to mind - namely, by 
  way of <b>object</b> and <b>powerful dependence. </b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therein object is sixfold as form, etc. But <b>powerful dependence</b>
is threefold - namely, powerful dependence as <b>object,</b> powerful dependence 
as <b>contiguity,</b>
and powerful dependence as <b>intrinsic nature.</b></p>

<p>Of them the object itself when it becomes prominent serves as a <b>powerful 
dependence</b> of the object. Consciousness and mental states that immediately 
cease, act as the <b>powerful dependence</b> <b>of proximity.</b> The <b>
powerful dependence of intrinsic nature</b> is of several kinds: states of lust, 
etc., states of confidence, etc., pleasure, pain, individual, food, season, 
lodging conditions, internal and external, as the case may be, are related to 
moral states, etc. Kamma, too, is similarly related to its effects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F. Mind and matter are related to mind and matter in nine ways according to 
  circumstances - namely, by way of <b>predominance, conascence, reciprocity, 
  dependence, nutriment, control, dissociation, presence,</b> and <b>non 
  separation.</b> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therein relation of <b>predominance</b> is twofold: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>i. The object to which weight is attached is related to states of mind by way 
of objective predominance. </p>

<p>ii. The fourfold coexisting predominance is related to coexisting mind and 
matter by way of conascence. </p>

<p>The relation of conascence is threefold: consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another and to the coexisting material states; the four Great 
Essentials mutually and to the derived material qualities; the heart-base and 
the resultant (mental aggregates) to one another at the moment of rebirth. </p>

<p>The relation of reciprocity is threefold: consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another; the four Great Essentials, to one another; the 
heart-base and the resultant mental aggregates to one another at the moment of 
rebirth. </p>

<p>The relation of dependence is threefold: consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another and coexisting matter; the four chief elements, to one 
another and derived material qualities; and six bases, to the seven cognitive 
elements. </p>

<p>The relation of nutriment is twofold: edible food is related to this body; 
and immaterial nutriment, to the coexisting mind and matter. </p>

<p>The relation of control is threefold: the five sensitive organs are related 
to the five kinds of cognition; the controlling power of material vitality, to 
the material qualities that have been grasped at; the immaterial controlling 
factors, to the coexistent mind and matter. </p>

<p>The law of dissociation is threefold: at the moment of conception the basis 
of mind is related to the effects (of kamma), and consciousness and mental 
states, to coexistent mind and matter by way of coexistence; the subsequent 
consciousness and mental states, to this antecedent body by way of 
post-occurrence; the six bases, in the course of life, to the seven cognitive 
elements by way of antecedence. </p>

<p>The five kinds of relations - coexistence, antecedence, post-occurrence, 
edible food, and material life - are, in every way, in the relation of presence 
and of non-separation. </p>

<p>All relations are included in the relations of object, powerful dependence, 
Kamma and presence. </p>

<p>Herein coexisting material qualities should be understood as twofold 
throughout the course of life they should be understood as those born of mind, 
and at rebirth as those born of kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus the relative conditions pertaining to the three periods of time and 
timeless, internal and external, conditioned and non-conditioned, are threefold 
by way of concept, mind and matter. </p>

<p>In all, the relations in Patthāna are twenty-four. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Hetu-paccaya</b> - Here <i>paccaya</i> presents some difficulty. It is 
defined as that by means of which an effect comes to be. In other words it is 
the cause. Furthermore, it is explained as a &#39;serviceable or supportive factor&#39; <i>
(upakārako dhammo).</i> <i>Hetu</i> is defined as &#39;that by which an effect is 
established&#39;. It is used in the sense of &#39;root&#39; <i>(mūlatthena).</i> Like the 
roots of a tree are hetu; like water and manure that aid its growth are <i>
paccaya.</i> In the Abhidhamma these two related terms are used in two different 
senses. In the Suttas, however, they are invariably employed as Synonymous 
terms, without any distinction, as, for example <i>ko hetu, ko paccayo</i> - 
what is the reason? what is the cause? </p>

<p>In the Patthāna 24 such <i>paccayas</i> are enumerated, and <i>hetu</i>
is one of them. <i>Hetu-paccaya</i> is explained as <i>&#39;hetu</i> itself is a <i>
paccaya&#39;</i>
or &#39;as <i>hetu</i> it becomes a <i>paccaya&#39;</i>. It is interpreted as a 
supportive or serviceable factor in the sense of root <i>(mūlatthena upakārako 
dhammo). </i>The causal relation by way of &#39;root&#39; may be suggested as the 
closest rendering. (See Compendium, p. 279; Journal of the Pāli Text Society, 
1915-1916, pp. 29-53.) </p>

<p>&#39;Roots are purely mental. They are the six moral and immoral roots. See 
Chapter 1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>ārammana</b> - or <b>ālambana</b>. The former is derived from <i>a + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> ram,</i> to delight in; the latter from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> 
lamb, </i>to hang upon. Things which the subject delights in or hangs upon are 
&#39;objects&#39;. There are six classes of objects. A form, for instance, acts as a 
causal relation to visual-consciousness by way of an &#39;object&#39;. It should be 
stated that there is nothing mundane or supramundane that does not become an 
object for mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Adhipati</b> - Lit., mastery or lordship over one&#39;s own. 0ne of the 
four dominant factors - namely, wish, thought, effort and reasoning - may, at 
one time, causally relate itself to coexistent mental states and material 
phenomena by way of predominance. &quot;Whenever such phenomena as consciousness and 
mental states arise by giving predominance to one of these four factors, then 
this phenomenon is to the other phenomenon a condition by way of predominance&quot;. 
(Patthāna)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>Anantara</b> and <b>Samanantara</b> - In meaning there is no 
difference between the two terms. They differ only in etymology. According to 
Buddhist philosophy one thought-moment perishes, immediately giving birth to 
another. The succeeding thought-moment inherits all the potentialities of its 
immediate predecessor. The perishing preceding states causally relate themselves 
to immediately following states by way of contiguity and immediacy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. <b>Sahajāta</b> - The causal relation by way of conascence, as, for 
instance, the four mental aggregates, the different mental states that 
simultaneously arise in a particular type of consciousness, the four Great 
Essentials that arise together, the appearance of the three &#39;decads&#39; at the 
moment of conception, etc. In the <i>paticca</i>-<i>samuppāda</i>
it may be mentioned that both contact and feeling which appear as causes and 
effect are conascent. </p>

<p>A mental state may be conascent with a mental state, a mental with a 
physical, a physical with a physical, and a physical with a mental. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Aññamañña</b> - Just as the legs of a tripod are reciprocally helpful, 
even so mental or physical state or states may be causally related by way of 
reciprocity (or mutuality). Causal relations of conascence and reciprocity 
should be differentiated. They are not identical. For instance, mind-born 
material phenomena are not reciprocally related to the coexisting mind, nor are 
the material derivatives to the coexisting Great Essentials. As a rule, mind and 
matter are reciprocally related. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Nissaya</b> and <b>Upanissaya</b> - derived from <i>upa + ni + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> si,</i> to lie. <i>Upa</i> is an intensive prefix. As trees depend on 
the ground for their support, and as pictures depend on a canvas on which they 
are painted, so is the causal relation of dependence. <i>Upanissaya</i> is 
defined as a stronger form of Nissaya. It is compared to the rains on which 
depend the growth of trees. S. Z. Aung renders <i>upanissaya</i> by &#39;sufficing 
condition&#39;. For instance, one of the five heinous crimes such as matricide, 
parricide and so on, will serve as an <i>upanissaya</i>
to effect a birth in a woeful state. Good environments, early education, etc., 
will serve as a causal relation by way of &#39;dependence&#39; (nissaya) for the 
acquisition of health, wealth and knowledge in later life. Just as good actions 
become <i>upanissaya</i> for future good deeds, even so they may become <i>
upanissaya</i> for evil too as, for instance, spiritual pride. See Ledi 
Sayadaw&#39;s learned article on this subject in P.T.S. Journal, 1916, pp. 49-53. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Purejāta</b> - lit., born before or that which pre-exists. The six 
physical bases and six sensual objects are regarded as pre-existent. The 
pre-existent things are regarded as causal relations only when they continue to 
exist in the present and not by mere antecedence. Priority is not a good 
rendering. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Pacchājāta</b> - Of the 89 types of consciousness, 85 types, excluding 
the four <i>arūpa</i> resultants, and the 52 mental states, are causally related 
to the antecedent physical body by way of post-occurrence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>āsevana</b> - Repeated practice, as a rule, leads to proficiency. This 
applies to both good and evil things. By repetition one acquires a certain 
amount of skill in any particular thing. <i>āsevana</i> denotes this repeated 
practice. In <i>javana</i> process the second thought moment is causally related 
to the first, the third to the second, the fourth to the third, by way of 
recurrence. This is the reason why the fourth <i>javana</i> thought-moment is 
considered very powerful. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Kamma</b> means the volition that plays the most important part in 
moral and immoral thoughts, words, and deeds. This volition, technically known 
as Kamma, is causally related to the Kamma-born material phenomena, etc. As a 
seed to a tree so is Kamma causally related to its inevitable results. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Vipāka</b> - Like a cool breeze that pacifies a person seated under 
the cool shade of a tree, even so mental states of resultant types of 
consciousness are causally related to coexistent mental states and material 
phenomena by way of &#39;effect&#39; due to their effortless peaceful nature. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>āhāra</b> - Just as material food sustains the physical body, even so 
mental foods sustain mental states. Edible food is causally related to the body 
by way of nutriment or food; so are mental contacts or impressions <i>(phassa)</i> 
to feelings; volitions or moral and immoral actions <i>(mano-sañetanā)</i> to 
rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi viññāna);</i> and rebirth-consciousness <i>
(viññāna)</i>
to mind and matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Indriya</b> - The controlling factors enumerated in Chapter VII become 
causally related to the coexistent mental states and material phenomena because 
they exercise control in their respective spheres. For instance, confidence 
controls its co-adjuncts in religious convictions; psychic and physical life, in 
vivifying mind and matter; mindfulness, in contemplative exercise; feelings, in 
grief and happiness, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Jhāna</b> - The seven <i>jhāna</i> factors of (1) initial application, 
(2) sustained application, (3) rapture, (4) happiness, (5) equanimity, (6) 
displeasure and (7) one-pointedness are causally related to one another and 
other concomitants by way of close perception and contemplation. For instance, 
the initial application <i>(vitakka)</i> is causally related to its concomitants 
in directing them towards the desired object. See Chapter 1. </p>

<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in two classes of consciousness rooted in attachment; 
1, 2, 6, 7, in hateful consciousness; 1, 2, 5, 7, in deluded consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Magga</b> - means a way or road. One way leads to woeful states; the 
other, to states of bliss. The vehicles that convey travelers to the former are 
the evil &#39;Path Constituents&#39; of wrong views, wrong application, wrong effort, 
and wrong one-pointedness. The vehicles that ply on the latter way are right 
understanding, right aspirations, right speech, right action, right livelihood, 
right effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness. These path factors 
are causally related to both mind and body, leading downwards in the case of bad 
ones, and leading away from existence (niyyāna) in the case of good ones. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Sampayutta</b> - Though possessing distinct characteristics from an 
ultimate standpoint yet, as certain mental states arise together, perish 
together, have one identical object and one identical base, they are causally 
related to one another by way of &#39;association&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. <b>Vippayutta</b> is the opposite of the foregoing. Sweet and bitter 
tastes may be helpful to each other in being dissimilar. For instance, mind that 
depends on the heart-basis is causally related to it by way of dissociation 
because, both mind and heart-basis are not mutually bound, as water on a lotus 
leaf. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Atthi</b> is the causal relation of states that exist in the present 
to similar states like the causal relation of coexistence. The visibility of 
objects, for instance, is due to the presence of light. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Natthi</b> - As with the disappearance of light, darkness spreads, so 
with the disappearance of the predecessor, the successor appears. Such is the 
causal relation by way of absence. For instance, the visual consciousness <i>
(dassana)</i>
is causally related to the immediately following receiving consciousness <i>
(sampaticchana)
</i>by way of absence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Vigata</b> and <b>Avigata</b> are similar to Natthi and Atthi 
respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. Therein the material states are just the aggregates of matter. </p>

<p>Consciousness and mental states, which comprise the four immaterial 
aggregates, and Nibbāna, are the five kinds that are immaterial. They are also 
called &#39;name&#39; <i>(nāma).</i> </p>

<p>The remaining <i>paññatti</i> (39) is twofold, inasmuch as it is made known, 
or as it </p>

<p>makes known.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>There are such terms as &#39;land&#39;, &#39;mountain&#39;, and the like, so designated on 
account of the mode of transition of the respective elements; such terms as 
&#39;house&#39;, &#39;chariot&#39;, &#39;cart&#39;, and the like, so named on account of the mode of 
formation of materials; such terms as &#39;person&#39; ,&#39;individual&#39;, and the like, so 
named on account of the five aggregates; such terms as &#39;direction&#39;, &#39;time&#39;, and 
the like, named according to the revolution of the moon and so forth; such terms 
as &#39;well&#39;, &#39;cave&#39;, and the like, so named on account of the mode of non-impact 
and so forth; such terms as Kasina-objects and the like, so named on account of 
respective elements and different mental culture. </p>

<p>All such different things, though they do not exist in an ultimate sense, 
become objects of thought in the form of shadows of (ultimate) things. </p>

<p>They are called <i>&#39;paññatti&#39;</i> because they are thought of, reckoned, 
understood, expressed, and made known on account of, in consideration of, with 
respect to, this or that mode. </p>

<p>This <i>&#39;paññatti&#39;</i> is so called because it is made known.</p>

<p>As it makes known it is called <i>&#39;paññatti&#39;</i>. it is described as &#39;name&#39;, 
&#39;name-made, etc. </p>

<p>It is sixfold (40): </p>

<p>1. A real concept, 2. an unreal concept, 3. an unreal concept by means of a 
real concept, 4. a real concept by means of an unreal concept, 5. a real concept 
by means of a real concept, 6. an unreal concept by means of an unreal concept. </p>

<p>As, for instance, when they make known by a term, such as &#39;matter&#39;, 
&#39;feeling&#39;, and so forth, that exist in reality, it is called a &#39;real concept&#39;. </p>

<p>When they make known by a term, such as &#39;land&#39;, &#39;mountain&#39; and so forth, that 
do not exist in reality, it is called an &#39;unreal concept&#39;. </p>

<p>The rest should respectively be understood by combining both as, for 
instance, &#39;possessor of sixfold supernormal vision&#39;, &#39;woman&#39;s voice&#39;, &#39;visual 
cognition&#39;, &#39;king&#39;s son&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By following the sound of speech through the process of auditory 
consciousness, and then by means of the concept conceived by mind-door that 
subsequently arises, are meanings understood. </p>

<p>These concepts should be understood as fashioned by world-convention. </p>

<p>This is the eighth chapter which deals with the Analysis of Causal Relations 
in the Compendium of Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Paññatti</b> - There are two kinds of <i>paññatti</i> or concepts - 
namely, <i>attha-paññatti</i> and <i>nāma-paññatti.</i> The former is made 
known, that is, the object conveyed by the concept. The latter is that which 
makes known, that is, the name given to the object. </p>

<p>Land, mountain, etc. are called <i>&#39;santhāna-paññatti&#39;</i>, formal concepts, 
since they correspond to the form of things. </p>

<p>Chariot, village, etc., are called <i>&#39;samūha-paññatti&#39;</i>, collective 
concepts, since they correspond to a collection or group of things. </p>

<p>East, west, etc., are called <i>&#39;disā-paññatti&#39;</i>, local concepts, since 
they correspond to locality. </p>

<p>Morning, noon, etc., are called <i>&#39;kāla-paññatti&#39;</i>, time concepts, since 
they correspond to time. </p>

<p>Well, cave, etc., are called <i>&#39;ākāsa-paññatti&#39;</i>, space-concepts, since 
they correspond to open space. </p>

<p>Visualized image, conceptualized image, etc. are called <i>&#39;nimitta-paññatti&#39;</i>, 
since they correspond to mental signs gained by mental development. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. Six kinds of <b>Paññatti</b> -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
