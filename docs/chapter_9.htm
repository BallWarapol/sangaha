<p><a name='7-72' href='?#7-72'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-73' href='?#7-73'>&nbsp;</a>§ 2. Of the two, in the Compendium of Calm, to with, the objects of mental 
culture are sevenfold: A. the ten Kasinas, B. the ten Impurities, C. The ten 
Reflections, D. the four Illimitables, E. the one Perception, F. the one 
Analysis, G. the four <i>arūpa-jhānas. </i></p>

<p><a name='7-75' href='?#7-75'>&nbsp;</a>The six kinds of temperaments (4): 1. the lustful, 2. the hateful, 3. the 
unintelligent, or ignorant, 4. the devout, or faithful, 5. the intellectual, or 
wise, 6. the discursive. </p>

<p><a name='7-76' href='?#7-76'>&nbsp;</a>The three stages of Mental Culture: 1. the preliminary (5), 2 . the 
proximate, 3. the concentrative. </p>

<p><a name='7-77' href='?#7-77'>&nbsp;</a>The three signs (6): 1. the preliminary, 2. the abstract, 3. the 
conceptualized. </p>

<p><a name='7-78' href='?#7-78'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-79' href='?#7-79'>&nbsp;</a>How ? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name='7-80' href='?#7-80'>&nbsp;</a>A. The ten kasinas (7) are; earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, 
  white, space, and light. </p>
  <p><a name='7-81' href='?#7-81'>&nbsp;</a>B. The ten Impurities (8) are: a bloated (corpse), a discoloured (corpse), 
  a festering, (corpse), a dissected (corpse), an eaten (corpse), a 
  scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a mutilated and scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a 
  bloody (corpse), a worm-infested (corpse), and a skeleton. </p>
  <p><a name='7-82' href='?#7-82'>&nbsp;</a>C. The ten Reflections (9) are: 1. The Reflection on the Buddha, 2. The 
  Reflection on the Doctrine, 3. The Reflection on the order, 4. The Reflection 
  on morality, 5. The Reflection on generosity, 6. The Reflection on deities, 7. 
  The Reflection on peace, 8. The Reflection on death, 9. Mindfulness regarding 
  the body, 10. Mindfulness regarding breathing (10). </p>
  <p><a name='7-83' href='?#7-83'>&nbsp;</a>D. The four Illimitables, also called Sublime States, (11), are: 
  loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity. </p>
  <p><a name='7-84' href='?#7-84'>&nbsp;</a>E. The one Perception is the feeling of loathsomeness about food (12). </p>
  <p><a name='7-85' href='?#7-85'>&nbsp;</a>F. The one Analysis is the analysis of the four elements (13). </p>
  <p><a name='7-86' href='?#7-86'>&nbsp;</a>G. The four <i>arūpa-jhānas</i> are the &#39;Infinity of Space&#39; (14) and so 
  forth. In the exposition of &#39;Calm&#39; there are altogether forty (15) subjects of 
  meditation. </p>

<p><a name='7-90' href='?#7-90'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-91' href='?#7-91'>&nbsp;</a>§ 3. With respect to temperaments the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness 
regarding the body&#39;, such as the 32 parts, are suitable for those of a lustful 
temperament (16). </p>

<p><a name='7-92' href='?#7-92'>&nbsp;</a>The four &#39;Illimitables&#39; and the four colored <i>kasinas</i> are suitable for 
those of a hateful temperament (17). </p>

<p><a name='7-93' href='?#7-93'>&nbsp;</a>The reflection on &#39;Breathing&#39; is suitable for those of an unintelligent and 
discursive temperament.</p>

<p><a name='7-94' href='?#7-94'>&nbsp;</a>The six Reflections on the Buddha and so forth are suitable for those of a 
devout temperament; Reflection on &#39;Death&#39;, &#39;Peace&#39;, &#39;Perception&#39;, and 
&#39;Analysis&#39;, for those of an intellectual temperament, and all the remaining 
subjects of mental culture, for all. </p>

<p><a name='7-95' href='?#7-95'>&nbsp;</a>Of the <i>kasinas</i> a wide one is suitable for the unintelligent, and a 
small one for the discursive.</p>

<p><a name='7-96' href='?#7-96'>&nbsp;</a>Herein this is the section on suitability. </p>

<p><a name='7-97' href='?#7-97'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-98' href='?#7-98'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-100' href='?#7-100'>&nbsp;</a>Stages of Mental Culture</p>

<p><a name='7-101' href='?#7-101'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-102' href='?#7-102'>&nbsp;</a>§ 4. The preliminary stage of mental culture is attainable in all these 
forty; subjects of meditation. In the ten subjects of mental culture such as the 
eight Reflections on the Buddha and so forth and the one &#39;Perception&#39;, and the 
one &#39;Analysis&#39; (18) only proximate mental culture is attained but not the 
concentrative stage. In the thirty remaining subjects of mental culture the 
concentrative stage of mental culture is also attained. </p>

<p><a name='7-103' href='?#7-103'>&nbsp;</a>Therein the ten <i>kasinas</i> and the &#39;Breathing&#39; produce five <i>jhānas;</i>
the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness regarding the body&#39; only the first <i>
jhāna;</i>
the first three &#39;Illimitables&#39; such as loving-kindness, four <i>jhānas;</i> 
&#39;equanimity&#39; (19) the fifth <i>jhāna.</i></p>

<p><a name='7-104' href='?#7-104'>&nbsp;</a>Thus these twenty-six subjects of mental culture produce <i>rūpa-jhānas.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='7-105' href='?#7-105'>&nbsp;</a>The four &#39;formless&#39; objects produce the <i>arūpa-jhānas.</i></p>

<p><a name='7-106' href='?#7-106'>&nbsp;</a>This is the section on mental culture. </p>

<p><a name='7-107' href='?#7-107'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-111' href='?#7-111'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-112' href='?#7-112'>&nbsp;</a>§ 5. Of the three signs, the preliminary sign and the abstract sign are 
generally obtained in every case according to the object. But the conceptualized 
image is obtained in the <i>&#39;Kasinas&#39;</i>, &#39;Impurities&#39;, &#39;Parts of the body&#39;, 
and &#39;Breathing&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-113' href='?#7-113'>&nbsp;</a>It is by means of the conceptualized image that the proximate on pointedness 
and the ecstatic one-pointedness are developed. </p>

<p><a name='7-114' href='?#7-114'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-115' href='?#7-115'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-116' href='?#7-116'>&nbsp;</a>How? </p>

<p><a name='7-117' href='?#7-117'>&nbsp;</a>Whatever object amongst the earth kasinas and so forth, a beginner takes to 
practice meditation, is called a preliminary sign and that meditation is 
preliminary mental culture. When that sign is perceived by the mind and enters 
the mind-door as if seen by the very (physical) eye then it is called the 
abstract sign. That meditation becomes well established.</p>

<p><a name='7-118' href='?#7-118'>&nbsp;</a>Likewise when a counter-image born of mediation, freed from original defects 
(20) reckoned as a concept, is well established and fixed in the mind of one who 
is well composed and who thereafter, practices meditation on the abstract sign 
by means of preliminary concentration then it is said that the conceptualized 
image has arisen. </p>

<p><a name='7-119' href='?#7-119'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-120' href='?#7-120'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-121' href='?#7-121'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-122' href='?#7-122'>&nbsp;</a>Rūpa Jhāna</p>

<p><a name='7-123' href='?#7-123'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-124' href='?#7-124'>&nbsp;</a>Thereafter &#39;proximate concentration&#39;, free from obstacles, pertaining to the <i>
kāma</i>-Sphere, arises. Then he who develops the conceptualized image by means 
of &#39;proximate concentration&#39; attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> of the <i>rūpa</i>-Sphere.
</p>

<p><a name='7-125' href='?#7-125'>&nbsp;</a>Thenceforth by bringing that very first <i>jhāna</i> under one&#39;s sway by 
means of these five kinds of mastery (21) - namely, reflection, attainment, 
resolution, emergence, and revision - the striving person, by inhibiting the 
coarse factors like &#39;initial application&#39; and so forth, and by developing the 
subtle factors like &#39;sustained application and so forth attains, by degrees, 
according to circumstances, to the second <i>jhāna</i>
and so forth. </p>

<p><a name='7-126' href='?#7-126'>&nbsp;</a>Thus with respect to twenty-two subjects of mental culture such as the earth 
kasina, etc., the conceptualized image is obtained. But in the remaining 
(eighteen) subjects of mental culture the &#39;Illimitables&#39; relate to the concept 
of beings.</p>

<p><a name='7-154' href='?#7-154'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Carita</b> signifies the intrinsic nature of a person, which is 
revealed when one is in a normal state without being preoccupied with anything. 
The temperaments of people differ owing to the diversity of their actions or 
Kammas. Habitual actions tend to form particular temperaments. </p>

<p><a name='7-155' href='?#7-155'>&nbsp;</a><i>Rāga</i> (lust) is predominant in some, while <i>dosa</i> (anger, hatred 
or ill will), in others. Most people belong to these two categories. There are a 
few others who lack intelligence and are more or less ignorant <i>(moha-carita).</i> 
Akin to the ignorant are those whose minds oscillate, unable to focus their 
attention deliberately on one thing <i>(vitakka-carita).</i> By nature some are 
exceptionally devout
<i>(saddhā-carita), </i>while others are exceptionally intelligent <i>
(buddhi-carita). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-156' href='?#7-156'>&nbsp;</a>Thus, in brief, there are six kinds of temperaments.</p>

<p><a name='7-157' href='?#7-157'>&nbsp;</a>By combining them with one another, we get 63 types. With the inclusion of <i>
ditthi-carita</i> (speculative temperament) there are 64. </p>

<p><a name='7-159' href='?#7-159'>&nbsp;</a>5. The preliminary stages of mental development are termed <i>
parikamma-bhāvanā</i>. Mental culture, from the moment one develops the 
conceptualized image and temporarily inhibits the Hindrances, until the <i>
gotrabhū</i> thought-moment in the <i>jhāna javana</i>
process, is termed <i>upacāra-bhāvanā</i>. </p>

<p><a name='7-160' href='?#7-160'>&nbsp;</a>The thought-moment that immediately follows the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is called <i>appanā,</i> ecstatic concentration, because vitakka 
(initial application), the foremost <i>jhāna</i> constituent, persists as if 
firmly fixed upon the object of concentration. </p>

<p><a name='7-161' href='?#7-161'>&nbsp;</a><i>Jhāna</i> Thought-Process: <i>manodvārāvajjana / parikamma, upacāra,

<p><a name='7-163' href='?#7-163'>&nbsp;</a>6. Any object, such as a <i>kasina,</i> used for preliminary mental culture 
is termed <i>&#39;parikamma-nimitta&#39;. </i></p>

<p><a name='7-164' href='?#7-164'>&nbsp;</a>The same object, when mentally perceived with closed eyes, is termed <i>

<p><a name='7-167' href='?#7-167'>&nbsp;</a>7. <b>Kasina</b> means &#39;whole, &#39;all, &#39;complete&#39;. It is so called because the 
light issuing from the conceptualized image is extended everywhere without any 
limitation.</p>

<p><a name='7-168' href='?#7-168'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of <i>pathavi-kasina</i> one makes a circle of about one span and 
four fingers in diameter and, covering it with dawn-coloured clay, smoothes it 
well. If there be not enough clay of dawn-coloured, he may put in some other 
kind of clay beneath. This prepared circle is known as <i>kasina-mandala</i> and 
is also called <i>parikamma-nimitta.</i>
Now he places this object two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on 
it, saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavi, pathavi</i> or earth, earth. The 
purpose is to gain one-pointedness of mind. When he does this for some time, 
perhaps weeks, or months, or years, he will be able to close his eyes and 
visualize the object. This visualized object is called <i>&#39;uggaha-nimitta&#39;.</i> 
Then he concentrates on this visualized image until it develops into a 
conceptualized or counter-image free from original <i>kasina</i> faults. This is 
known as the &#39;patibhāganimitta&#39;. As he continually concentrates on this abstract 
concept he is said to be in possession of proximate or neighborhood 
concentration <i>(upacāra-samādhi).</i>
At this stage the innate five Hindrances are temporarily inhibited. Eventually 
he gains &#39;ecstatic concentration&#39; <i>(appanā samādhi). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-169' href='?#7-169'>&nbsp;</a>For the water-<i>kasina</i> one may take a vessel full of colourless water, 
preferably rain water, and concentrate on it, saying - <i>āpo, āpo,</i> (water, 
water) until he gains one-pointedness of mind. </p>

<p><a name='7-170' href='?#7-170'>&nbsp;</a>To develop the fire-<i>kasina</i> one may kindle a fire before him and 
concentrate on it through a hole, a span and four fingers in diameter, in a 
rush-mat, a piece of leather, or a piece of cloth, saying <i>tejo, tejo,</i> 
(fire, fire). </p>

<p><a name='7-171' href='?#7-171'>&nbsp;</a>One who develops the air-<i>kasina</i> concentrates on the wind that enters 
through window space or a hole in the wall, saying, <i>vāyo, vāyo</i> (air, 
air).
</p>

<p><a name='7-172' href='?#7-172'>&nbsp;</a>To develop the colour-<i>kasinas</i> one may take a <i>mandala</i> of the 
prescribed size, and colour it blue, yellow, red, or white and concentrate on 
it, repeating the name of the colour as in the case of the other <i>kasinas. </i></p>

<p><a name='7-173' href='?#7-173'>&nbsp;</a>One may even concentrate on blue, yellow, red, or white flowers. </p>

<p><a name='7-174' href='?#7-174'>&nbsp;</a>Light <i>kasina</i> may be developed by concentrating on the moon, or on an 
unflickering lamplight, or on a circle of light cast on the ground, or on the 
wall by sunlight or moonlight entering through a wall-crevice or hole, saying - <i>
āloka, āloka</i> (light, light). </p>

<p><a name='7-175' href='?#7-175'>&nbsp;</a>Space-kasina can be developed by concentrating on a hole, a span and four

  Nibbāna, to be understood by the wise, each one for himself&quot;. </p>
  <p><a name='7-183' href='?#7-183'>&nbsp;</a>iii. <b>Sanghānussati</b> is the reflection on the virtues of the pure

  <p><a name='7-188' href='?#7-188'>&nbsp;</a>viii. Maranānussati is reflection on the termination of psycho physical 
  life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name='7-189' href='?#7-189'>&nbsp;</a>Contemplation on death enables one to comprehend the fleeting nature of

	and for the development of others, instead of wholly indulging in sensual 
	pleasures. Constant meditation on death does not make one pessimistic and

  hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, etc. This meditation on the 
  loathsomeness of the body, leads to dispassion. Many Bhikkhus in the time of 
  the Buddha attained Arahatship by meditating on these impurities. If one is

  means inhalation and <i>apāna</i> exhalation. In some books these two terms 
  are explained in the reverse way. Concentration on the breathing process leads 
  to one-pointedness of the mind, and ultimately to Insight which leads to 
  Arahatship. </p>

<p><a name='7-197' href='?#7-197'>&nbsp;</a>10. This is one of the best subjects of meditation, which appeals equally to 
all. The Buddha also practiced <i>ānāpānasati</i> before His Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='7-198' href='?#7-198'>&nbsp;</a>A detailed exposition of this meditation is found in the Satipatthāna Sutta 
and in the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p><a name='7-199' href='?#7-199'>&nbsp;</a>A few practical hints are given here for the benefit of the average reader. </p>

<p><a name='7-200' href='?#7-200'>&nbsp;</a>Adopting a convenient posture, breathe out and close the mouth. Then breathe 
in through the nostrils calmly, without strain. Inhale first and count mentally 
one. Exhale and count two, concentrating on the breathing process. In this 
manner count up to ten, constantly focusing your attention on respiration. It is 
possible for the mind to wander before one counts up to ten. But one need not be 
discouraged. Try again until success is achieved. Gradually one can increase the 
number of series, say five series of ten. Later one can concentrate on the 
breathing process without counting. Some prefer counting as it aids 
concentration; while others prefer not to count. What is essential is 
concentration, and not counting, which is secondary. When one does this 
concentration exercise one feels light in body and mind and very peaceful. One 
might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. When one practices this 
concentration for a certain period, a day may come when one will realize that 
his so-called body is supported by mere breath, and that the body perishes when 
breathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes impermanence. Where there is change 
there cannot be a permanent entity or an immortal soul. Insight might then be 
developed to gain Arahatship. </p>

<p><a name='7-201' href='?#7-201'>&nbsp;</a>It is now clear that the object of this concentration on respiration is not 
merely to gain one-pointedness but also to cultivate Insight in order to obtain 
Deliverance. </p>

<p><a name='7-202' href='?#7-202'>&nbsp;</a>This simple method may be pursued by all without any harm. </p>

<p><a name='7-203' href='?#7-203'>&nbsp;</a>For more details readers are referred to the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p><a name='7-204' href='?#7-204'>&nbsp;</a>In some Suttas this simple method of respiration is explained as follows: </p>

three characteristics - impermanence in the sense of dissolution, suffering in 
the sense of fearfulness, and soullessness in the sense of unsubstantiality - by

<p><a name='7-374' href='?#7-374'>&nbsp;</a>24. <b>Vipassanā</b> or Insight is the third and final stage on the Path of 
Sainthood. The chief object of Insight is to understand things as they truly 
are. </p>

<p><a name='7-375' href='?#7-375'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-376' href='?#7-376'>&nbsp;</a>25. <b>Anicca,</b> i.e., the fleeting nature of both mind and matter. 
Changeableness is a characteristic of everything that is conditioned. All 
conditioned things are constantly changing, not remaining static for two 
consecutive moments. Mind, in fact, changes even faster than matter. Normally 
matter endures only for seventeen thought-moments. Commentators state that, 
during the time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments 
may arise. </p>

<p><a name='7-377' href='?#7-377'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-378' href='?#7-378'>&nbsp;</a>26. <b>Dukkha</b> - All conditioned things are subject to suffering. Birth is 
suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering. Union 
with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant is suffering. Not 
to get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates of 
attachment are suffering.</p>

<p><a name='7-379' href='?#7-379'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-380' href='?#7-380'>&nbsp;</a>27. <b>Anattā</b> - Or Soullessness is the crux of Buddhism. As there is no 
permanent entity in matter, so also there is no unchanging entity in mind 
conceived as an &#39;ego&#39; or soul&#39;. In everything mundane and supramundane 
conditioned and non-conditioned, there is no permanent soul. Hence the Buddha in 
the Dhammapada stated <i>&#39;sabbe dhammā anattā</i> - all dhammas are soulless&#39;. 
With regard to <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i>
the Buddha said <i>&#39;sankhārā</i> - conditioned things&#39;. With regard to <i>
anattā,</i>
the Buddha employed the term <i>dhammā</i> to include supramundane unconditioned 
Nibbāna as well. </p>

<p><a name='7-381' href='?#7-381'>&nbsp;</a>It may be mentioned that it was after hearing the &#39;Anattalakkhana Sutta&#39;, the 
discourse on soullessness, that the first five monks attained Arahatship. </p>

<p><a name='7-382' href='?#7-382'>&nbsp;</a>The aspirant does not usually meditate on all these three characteristics. Of 
them, he takes only that which appeals to him most. Deliverance, gained by 
meditating on one of them, is named accordingly. </p>

<p><a name='7-383' href='?#7-383'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-384' href='?#7-384'>&nbsp;</a>28. <b>Sammasanañana</b> - Lit., &#39;handling-knowledge&#39;, is the investigating

<p><a name='7-386' href='?#7-386'>&nbsp;</a>29. <b>Patisankhāñāna</b> is the recontemplation of conditioned things in 
order to find out the means to escape the refrom. </p>

<p><a name='7-387' href='?#7-387'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-388' href='?#7-388'>&nbsp;</a>30. <b>Sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</b> is perfect equanimity towards all conditioned 
things, having neither attachment nor aversion, resulting from developing the 
foregoing different kinds of Insight. </p>

<p><a name='7-389' href='?#7-389'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-390' href='?#7-390'>&nbsp;</a>31. <b>Anuloma-ñāna</b> is the &#39;adaptation knowledge&#39; gained by perfecting 
the foregoing nine kinds of Insight. It is so called because it conforms itself 
to 37 Factors of Enlightenment and qualifies the aspirant for the higher path. </p>

<p><a name='7-391' href='?#7-391'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-394' href='?#7-394'>&nbsp;</a>33. <b>Suññata</b> - devoid of a soul. Emancipation gained by meditating on 
soullessness <i>(anattā) </i>is called <i>suññata-vimokkha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='7-395' href='?#7-395'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-396' href='?#7-396'>&nbsp;</a>34. <b>Animitta</b> - free from the signs of permanence, etc. Emancipation 
gained by meditating on &#39;impermanence&#39; <i>(anicca)</i> is called <i>
animitta-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='7-397' href='?#7-397'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-398' href='?#7-398'>&nbsp;</a>35. <b>Appanihita</b> - free from the hankering of craving. Emancipation

appanihita-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='7-399' href='?#7-399'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-400' href='?#7-400'>&nbsp;</a>36. <b>Sīlavisuddhi</b> - Purity of Morals, is the first of seven &#39;Purities&#39;. 
It consists of four kinds, all pertaining to the life of a Bhikkhu.</p>

<p><a name='7-401' href='?#7-401'>&nbsp;</a>The first is <i>pātimokkhasamvarasīla.</i> &#39;That which saves one who observes 
it from woeful states&#39; is the commentarial explanation of <i>&#39;pātimokkha&#39;.</i> <i>
Pā</i>
is also explained as the Buddhas Teaching. <i>Atipamokkha</i> means extremely 
important. <i>Pātimokkha</i>
therefore means &quot;Fundamental Teaching&quot; or &quot;Fundamental Precepts&quot;. It deals with 
220* disciplinary rules which every Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it 
restrains one from evil deeds, etc., it is termed <i>&#39;samvara&#39;.</i> Sīla is used 
in the sense of &#39;composure&#39; <i>(samādhāna) </i>and &#39;support&#39; <i>(upadhārana).</i> 
It is so called because it tends to discipline thoughts, words, and deeds, and 
because it acts as a support for other virtues. <i>Indrivasamvarasīla</i> the 
second <i>sīla,</i> deals with the control of the six senses. <i>
ājīvapārisuddhisīla,</i> the third <i>sīla,</i>
deals with the right livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the necessaries of 
life, a Bhikkhu should not act in an unbecoming way. <i>Paccayasannissitasīla</i> 
the fourth <i>sīla,</i>
is concerned with the unselfish use of the four requisites - robes, alms, 
lodging, and medicine.</p>

<p><a name='7-404' href='?#7-404'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-405' href='?#7-405'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Cittavisuddhi</b> - is the second &#39;Purity. It is the purity of mind, 
gained by developing the <i>jhānas,</i> temporarily inhibiting the Hindrances. A 
purified mind is like a polished mirror where everything is reflected in its 
true perspective. With a purified mind one can see things as they truly are. </p>

<p><a name='7-406' href='?#7-406'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-407' href='?#7-407'>&nbsp;</a>38. <b>Ditthivisuddhi</b> - is the third &#39;Purity&#39;. It is so called because it 
purifies one from the false theory of a permanent soul. This correct 
comprehension results from investigating mind and matter as regards their 
salient characteristics <i>(lakkhana),</i> function or essential properties <i>
(rasa),</i> the way of manifestation <i>(paccupatthāna),</i> and their immediate 
cause <i>(padatthāna). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-408' href='?#7-408'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-409' href='?#7-409'>&nbsp;</a>39. <b>Kankhāvitaranavisuddhi</b> - is the fourth &#39;Purity&#39; which attempts to 
transcend skeptical doubts as regards cause and effect, the past, the present, 
and the future. This is called a purity because it removes the stain of 
erroneous views of &#39;chance&#39;, causelessness&#39;, etc.</p>

<p><a name='7-410' href='?#7-410'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-411' href='?#7-411'>&nbsp;</a>To achieve this purity one meditates on the various causes that tend to 
produce present mind and matter, and on the causes that sustain them in the 
present. He understands that present mind and matter at conception were 
conditioned by past ignorance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, during 
lifetime, matter is conditioned by kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and edible 
food, while mind is sustained by the senses and their corresponding objects. 
Thus he realizes the second noble truth of the cause of suffering and rids 
himself of doubts. </p>

<p><a name='7-412' href='?#7-412'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-413' href='?#7-413'>&nbsp;</a>40. <b>Maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi</b> - This is the fifth &#39;Purity&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-414' href='?#7-414'>&nbsp;</a>The aspirant ho has cleared his doubts, meditates again with better 
understanding on the three characteristics of <i>anicca, dukkha,</i> and <i>
anattā.</i>
He realizes that life is a mere flowing, a continuous undivided movement. He 
finds no genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to 
pain. What is transient is painful, and where change and sorrow prevail there 
cannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising and passing away of conditioned 
things become very conspicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed in meditation he 
witnesses an aura <i>(obhāso)</i> emanating from his body as a result of his 
keen insight. He experiences also an unprecedented joy <i>(pīti),
</i>happiness <i>(sukha),</i> and quietude <i>(passaddhi).</i> He becomes 
strenuous <i>(paggaho)
</i>and even-minded <i>(upekkhā).</i> His religious fervour increases <i>
(adhimokkha),</i>
mindfulness <i>(sati) </i>strengthens, and wisdom <i>(ñāna)</i> ripens. Laboring 
under the misconception that he has attained Sainthood, chiefly owing to the 
presence of the aura, he yearns <i>(nikanti)</i> for this state of mind. Soon he 
realizes that these temptations are only impediments <i>(upakkilesa) </i>to 
Insight, and that he has not really attained Sainthood. Accordingly he 
endeavours to distinguish between the right and wrong path <i>
(maggāmaggañānadassana).</i> It is called a &#39;purity because it clears up the 
misconception as regards the actual &#39;path&#39;. He understands, &#39;This is the right 
path, that is the wrong path&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-416' href='?#7-416'>&nbsp;</a>41. <b>Patipadāñānadassanavisuddhi</b> - is the sixth &#39;Purity&#39;. This term is 
collectively applied to the nine kinds of Insight beginning with the knowledge 
as regards the arising and passing away of conditioned things, and ending with 
the knowledge of adaptation that occurs in the Path thought-moment immediately 
preceding the <i>gotrabhū</i>
moment. (See p. <a HREF="#page429">*</a>, footnote ) </p>

<p><a name='7-420' href='?#7-420'>&nbsp;</a>43. See pp. <a HREF="#page218">218*</a>, <a HREF="#page414">414*</a>. </p>

sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</i>
and <i>anuloma-ñāna</i> of the ten kinds of Insight. It is so called because it 
leads to the Path emerging from woeful states and signs of conditioned things. </p>

<p><a name='7-423' href='?#7-423'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-424' href='?#7-424'>&nbsp;</a>45. <b>Gotrabhū</b> - lit, means &#39;overcoming the worldly lineage&#39;. The object 
of this thought-moment is Nibbāna, but the actual realization of Nibbāna by the 
eradication of passions occurs at the Path thought-moment that immediately 
follows. This particular thought-moment in the three higher stages of Sainthood 
is termed <i>&#39;vodāna&#39;</i>
(pure) as the aspirant is already an Ariya. </p>

<p><a name='7-425' href='?#7-425'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-426' href='?#7-426'>&nbsp;</a>46. Immediately after the <i>gotrabhū</i> thought-moment there arises the 
Path thought-moment of the Sotāpanna. It is at this stage that one comprehends 
the Truth of Suffering, eradicates craving, the cause of suffering, and actually 
realizes Nibbāna for the first time in his life. The eight factors that 
constitute the Noble Path are also fully developed at this stage. This 
particular thought-moment is termed <i>&#39;sotāpatti-magga&#39;.</i>
<i>Sota</i> here means the stream that leads to Nibbāna. It is the Noble 
Eightfold Path. <i>āpatti</i>
means &#39;entering for the first time&#39;. It is called <i>&#39;magga&#39;</i> because it 
arises, destroying the passions. This Path thought-moment arises only once in 
the course of one&#39;s lifetime, and is immediately followed by two or three 
&#39;Fruit&#39; <i>(phala)</i> moments before the stream of consciousness lapses into <i>
bhavanga.</i> This is the reason why the Dhamma is called <i>&#39;akālika&#39;</i> 
(immediately effective). </p>

<p><a name='7-427' href='?#7-427'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-428' href='?#7-428'>&nbsp;</a>47. <b>Paccavekkhanañānāni</b> - As a rule after each of the four stages of 
Sainthood one reflects on the Path and Fruit one has attained, on the Nibbāna 
one has realized, on the defilements one has destroyed, and in the case of the 
first three stages, on the defilements one has yet to destroy. An Arahat who has 
no more defilements to destroy knows that he is delivered. </p>

<p><a name='7-429' href='?#7-429'>&nbsp;</a>There are altogether 19 kinds of such reflective knowledge, 15 pertaining to 
the first three stages of Sainthood, and 4 to the last stage. </p>

<p><a name='7-430' href='?#7-430'>&nbsp;</a>The Pāli phrase - <i>n&#39;āparam itthatthāya</i> - No more of this state again -

<p><a name='7-432' href='?#7-432'>&nbsp;</a>48. <b>Nānadassanavisuddhi</b> is the name given to the contemplative 
knowledge, a mental state of wisdom found in the Path-Consciousness. It is 
called a &#39;purity&#39;, because it is completely free from all stains or defilements, 
resulting from the realization of the four Truths. It is the seventh &#39;purity&#39;. </p>

The contemplation of impermanence, that discards the signs of false notion (50), 
becomes an avenue of Emancipation, and is termed &#39;Signless-contemplation. The 
contemplation of suffering, that discards the hankering of attachment (51), 
becomes an avenue of Emancipation and is termed &#39;Unhankering-contemplation&#39; . </p>

<p><a name='7-500' href='?#7-500'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-501' href='?#7-501'>&nbsp;</a>When the <i>jhānas</i> are developed, the mind is so purified, that it 
resembles a polished mirror, where everything is clearly reflected in true 
perspective. Still, there is not complete freedom from unwholesome thoughts, 
for, by concentration, the evil tendencies are only temporarily inhibited. They 
may rise to the surface at quite unexpected moments. </p>

<p><a name='7-502' href='?#7-502'>&nbsp;</a>Discipline regulates words and deeds; concentration controls the mind; but it 
is Insight <i>(paññā)</i> the third and the final stage, that enables the 
aspirant to Sainthood to eradicate wholly the defilements inhibited by <i>
samādhi</i>. </p>

<p><a name='7-503' href='?#7-503'>&nbsp;</a>At the outset he cultivates &#39;Purity of Vision&#39; <i>(ditthi visuddhi)</i>
(the third member of the Path of Purity) in order to see things as they truly 
are. With a one-pointed mind he analyses and examines this so-called being. This 
searching examination shows that what he has called &#39;I&#39;, is merely a complex 
compound of mind and matter which are in a state of constant flux. </p>

<p><a name='7-504' href='?#7-504'>&nbsp;</a>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of this so-called being, 
freed from the false notion of a permanent soul, he searches for the causes of 
this &#39;I&#39; personality. He realizes that there is nothing in the world which is 
not conditioned by some cause or causes, past or present, and that his present 
existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>(tanhā),</i> 
attachment <i>(upādāna),</i> Kamma, and physical food of the present life. On 
account of these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and as past causes 
have conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. 
Meditating thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to past, present and 
future (<i>kankhāvitaranavisuddhi,</i> the fourth member of the Path of Purity). </p>

<p><a name='7-505' href='?#7-505'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-506' href='?#7-506'>&nbsp;</a>Thereupon he contemplates the truth that all conditioned things are transient <i>
(anicca), </i>subject to suffering <i>(dukkha),</i> and devoid of an immortal 
soul <i>(anattā).</i> Wherever he turns his eyes he sees naught but these three 
characteristics standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a flux 
conditioned by internal and external causes. Nowhere does he find any genuine 
happiness for everything is fleeting. </p>

<p><a name='7-507' href='?#7-507'>&nbsp;</a>As he thus contemplates the real nature of life, and is absorbed in 
meditation a day comes, when, to his surprise, he witnesses an aura <i>(obhāsa)</i>
emitted by his body. He experiences an unprecedented pleasure happiness and 
quietude. He becomes even-minded, his religious fervour increases, mindfulness 
becomes clear and insight keen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress 
for Sainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking 
for this mental state. Soon the realization comes that these new developments 
are impediments to moral progress and he cultivates the purity of knowledge with 
regard to the Path and Non-Path (<i>maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi,</i>
the fifth member of the Path of Purity).</p>

<p><a name='7-508' href='?#7-508'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-509' href='?#7-509'>&nbsp;</a>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of all conditioned things. Of 
these two states the latter becomes more impressed on his mind since change is 
more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he directs his attention to 
contemplation of the dissolution of things
<i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He perceives that both mind and matter which constitute 
this so-called being are in a state of constant flux, not remaining the same for 
two consecutive moments. To him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving 
things are fearful <i>(bhaya ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a 
pit of burning embers, a source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the 
wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava ñāna) </i>of the fearful and deluded world, 
and develops a feeling of disgust <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i> followed by a strong 
will for deliverance from it <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-510' href='?#7-510'>&nbsp;</a>With this object in view, he resumes his meditation on the three 
characteristics of transiency, sorrow, and soullessness <i>(patisankhā ñāna),</i> 
and thereafter develops complete equanimity towards all conditioned things, 
having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly object <i>(upekkhā 
ñāna).*</i> <a NAME="page429"></a></p>

mind&quot;. (Dr. Paul Dahlke)</p>

<p><a name='7-522' href='?#7-522'>&nbsp;</a>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time he is called a

<p><a name='7-526' href='?#7-526'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name='7-527' href='?#7-527'>&nbsp;</a>1. <b>Sakkāya-ditthi</b> - <i>sati + kāye + ditthi,</i> literally, view 
  when a group exists. Here <i>kāya</i> refers to the five Aggregates of matter, 
  feeling, perception, mental states, and consciousness, or, in other words, to 
  the complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging 
  entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho physical 
  aggregates is termed <i>sakkāya-ditthi.</i>
  Dhammasangani enumerates twenty kinds of such soul theories (s<font SIZE="2">ee 
  Dhammasangani Translation, pp. 257-259)</font>. <i>Sakkāya-ditthi</i> is 
  usually rendered by self-illusion, theory of individuality, illusion of 
  individualism. </p>
  <p><a name='7-528' href='?#7-528'>&nbsp;</a>2. <b>Vicikicchā</b> - Doubts. They are doubts about 1. the Buddha, 2. the 
  Dhamma, 3. the Sangha, 4. the disciplinary rules <i>(sikkhā), </i>5. the past, 
  6. the future, 7. both the past and the future, and 8. Dependent Arising <i>
  (paticca-samuppāda).</i>
  (see Dhammasangani Translation p. 239)</p><p><a name='7-529' href='?#7-529'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Sīlabbataparāmāsa</b> - Adherence to (wrongful) rites and 
	ceremonies. </p>
  <p><a name='7-530' href='?#7-530'>&nbsp;</a>Dhammasangani explains it thus: &quot;It is the theory held by ascetics an 
  Brahmins outside this doctrine, that purification is obtained by rules of 
  moral conduct, or by rites, or by both rules of moral conduct and rites&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='7-531' href='?#7-531'>&nbsp;</a>For the eradication of the remaining seven Fetters a Sotāpanna is reborn 
seven times at most. He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and 
the Sangha. He would not for any reason violate any of the five precepts. He is 
not subject to states of woe as he is destined for Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='7-532' href='?#7-532'>&nbsp;</a>With fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, the noble 
pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight, becomes a Sakadāgāmi - 
Once-Returner - reaching the second stage of Sainthood by attenuating two other 
Fetters, namely, sense-desires <i>(kāmāraga)</i> and ill will <i>(patigha).</i> </p>

<p><a name='7-533' href='?#7-533'>&nbsp;</a>Now he is called a Once-Returner because he is born in the human realm only 
once, should he not attain Arahatship in that birth itself. It is interesting to 
note that the Ariya Saint who has attained the second stage of Sainthood can 
only weaken these two powerful Fetters with which he is bound from a 
beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he harbours thoughts of 
lust and anger. </p>

<p><a name='7-534' href='?#7-534'>&nbsp;</a>It is by attaining the third State of Sainthood, that of the Anāgāmi 
(Never-Returner), that he completely eradicates these two Fetters. Thereafter he 
neither returns to this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, since he 
has rooted out the desire for sensual gratification. After death he is reborn in 
the Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsa), an environment exclusively reserved for Anāgāmis 
and Arahats. </p>

<p><a name='7-535' href='?#7-535'>&nbsp;</a>A layman may become an Anāgāmi, provided he leads a celibate life. </p>

<p><a name='7-536' href='?#7-536'>&nbsp;</a>The Anāgāmi Saint now makes his final advance and destroying the remaining 
five Fetters, namely, attachment to Realms of Form <i>(rūparāga)</i>
attachment to Formless Realms <i>(arūparāga),</i> pride <i>(māna), </i>
restlessness <i>(uddhacca),
</i>and ignorance <i>(avijjā), </i>attains Arahatship the final state of 
Sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='7-537' href='?#7-537'>&nbsp;</a>Stream-Winners, Once-Returners, Never-Returners are called Sekhas because 
they have yet to undergo training. Arahats are called Asekhas because they no 
longer need any training. </p>

<p><a name='7-538' href='?#7-538'>&nbsp;</a>An Arahat, literally, a Worthy One, is not subject to rebirth because he does 
not accomplish fresh Karmic activities, the seeds of his reproduction in matter 
have all been destroyed. </p>

<p><a name='7-539' href='?#7-539'>&nbsp;</a>The Arahat realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done. A heavy 
burden of sorrow has finally been relinquished, and all forms of craving and all 
shades of ignorance are totally annihilated. The happy pilgrim now stands on 
heights more than celestial, far removed from uncontrolled passions and the 
defilements of the world. </p>

<p><a name='7-586' href='?#7-586'>&nbsp;</a>As invited by Namba, a person of refined manners, belonging to a respectable 
family, full of faith and replete with sterling virtues, to compose a treatise 
out of compassion for others, this book has been completed. </p>

<p><a name='7-587' href='?#7-587'>&nbsp;</a>By this great merit may the modest monks, ho are purified by wisdom and who 
shine in discipline, remember till the end of the world the most famous

<p><a name='7-592' href='?#7-592'>&nbsp;</a>56. <b>Nirodhasamāpatti</b> - Lit., &#39;attainment to cessation&#39;. It is so 
called because during this period the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases 
to flow. Mind is suspended, but vitality persists. </p>

<p><a name='7-593' href='?#7-593'>&nbsp;</a>It is only an Anāgāmi or an Arahat who has developed the <i>rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i> <i>jhānas</i> who can attain to this supreme state of ecstasy. </p>

<p><a name='7-594' href='?#7-594'>&nbsp;</a>When such a person wishes to attain to <i>nirodhasamāpatti,</i> he first 
attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> and, emerging from it, he meditates on the 
transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of conditioned states found in that 
particular
<i>jhāna.</i> Likewise, he attains, in order, to the remaining <i>jhānas</i> and 
meditates in the same way until the <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of &#39;Nothingness&#39;.</p>

<p><a name='7-595' href='?#7-595'>&nbsp;</a>Emerging from this <i>jhāna,</i> he makes the following four resolutions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><a name='7-596' href='?#7-596'>&nbsp;</a>(i) that his fourfold requisites be not destroyed, </p>
        <p><a name='7-597' href='?#7-597'>&nbsp;</a>(ii) that he should arise in time when his services are needed by the 
		Sangha, </p>
        <p><a name='7-598' href='?#7-598'>&nbsp;</a>(iii) that he should arise in time when he is summoned by the Buddha, </p>
        <p><a name='7-599' href='?#7-599'>&nbsp;</a>(iv) whether he will live for more than seven days from that moment. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='7-600' href='?#7-600'>&nbsp;</a>He has to think of his age-limit as this ecstatic state normally extends to 
seven days. </p>

<p><a name='7-601' href='?#7-601'>&nbsp;</a>After making these resolutions, he attains to the last <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of 
&#39;Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;, and remains in that state for two <i>
javana</i>
thought moments. Immediately after, he attains to <i>nirodha-samāpatti</i> when 
his stream of consciousness, is temporarily suspended. After seven days he 
emerges from this state and experiences for a single moment an Anāgāmi Phala 
consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat Phala consciousness in the 
case of an Arahat. Thereafter arises the <i>bhavanga citta. </i></p>
