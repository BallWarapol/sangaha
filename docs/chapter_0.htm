<p><a name='5-9' href='?#5-9'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='5-10' href='?#5-10'>&nbsp;</a>Abhidhamma, as the term implies, is the Higher Teaching of the Buddha. It 
expounds the quintessence of His profound doctrine. </p>

<p><a name='5-11' href='?#5-11'>&nbsp;</a>The Dhamma, embodied in the Sutta Pitaka, is the conventional teaching <i>
(vohāra desanā),</i> and the Abhidhamma is the ultimate teaching <i>(paramattha 
desanā)</i> </p>

<p><a name='5-12' href='?#5-12'>&nbsp;</a>In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, which constitute this complex 
machinery of man, are microscopically analyzed. Chief events connected with the 
process of birth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of the 
Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms. </p>

<p><a name='5-13' href='?#5-13'>&nbsp;</a>Modern Psychology, limited as it is comes within the scope of Abhidhamma 
inasmuch as it deals with the mind, with thoughts, thought-processes, and mental 
states but it does not admit of a psyche or a soul. Buddhism teaches a 
psychology without a psyche. </p>

<p><a name='5-14' href='?#5-14'>&nbsp;</a>If one were to read the Abhidhamma as a modern textbook on psychology, one 
would be disappointed. No attempt has here been made to solve all the problems 
that confront a modern psychologist. </p>

<p><a name='5-15' href='?#5-15'>&nbsp;</a>Consciousness is defined. Thoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from 
an ethical standpoint. All mental states are enumerated. The composition of each 
type of consciousness is set forth in detail. The description of 
thought-processes that arise through the five sense-doors and the mind-door is 
extremely interesting. Such a clear exposition of thought-processes cannot be 
found in any other psychological treatise. </p>

<p><a name='5-16' href='?#5-16'>&nbsp;</a><i>Bhavanga</i> and <i>Javana</i> thought-moments, which are explained only 
in the Abhidhamma, and which have no parallel in modern psychology, are of 
special interest to a research student in psychology. </p>

<p><a name='5-17' href='?#5-17'>&nbsp;</a>That consciousness flows like a stream, a view propounded by some modern 
psychologists like William James, becomes extremely clear to one who understands 
the Abhidhamma. It must be added that an Abhidhamma student can fully comprehend 
the <i>Anattā</i>
(No-soul) doctrine, the crux of Buddhism, which is important both from a 
philosophical and an ethical standpoint. </p>

<p><a name='5-18' href='?#5-18'>&nbsp;</a>The advent of death, process of rebirth in various planes without anything to 
pass from one life to another, the evidently verifiable doctrine of Kamma and 
Rebirth are fully explained. </p>

<p><a name='5-19' href='?#5-19'>&nbsp;</a>Giving a wealth of details about mind, Abhidhamma discusses the second factor 
of man-matter or <i>rūpa.</i> Fundamental units of matter, material forces, 
properties of matter, source of matter, relationship of mind and matter, are 
described. </p>

<p><a name='5-20' href='?#5-20'>&nbsp;</a>In the Abhidhammattha Sangaha there is a brief exposition of the Law of 
Dependent Origination, followed by a descriptive account of the Causal Relations 
that finds no parallel in any other philosophy. </p>

<p><a name='5-21' href='?#5-21'>&nbsp;</a>A physicist should not delve into Abhidhamma to get a thorough knowledge of 
physics. </p>

<p><a name='5-22' href='?#5-22'>&nbsp;</a>It should be made clear that Abhidhamma does not attempt to give a 
systematized knowledge of mind and matter. It investigates these two composite 
factors of so-called being to help the understanding of things as they truly 
are. A philosophy has been developed on these lines. Based on that philosophy, 
an ethical system has been evolved to realize the ultimate goal, Nibbāna. </p>

<p><a name='5-23' href='?#5-23'>&nbsp;</a>As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly says, Abhidhamma deals with &quot;(1) What we find (a) 
within us (b) around us and of (2) what we aspire to find.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='5-24' href='?#5-24'>&nbsp;</a>In Abhidhamma all irrelevant problems that interest students and scholars, 
but having no relation to one&#39;s Deliverance, are deliberately set aside. </p>

<p><a name='5-25' href='?#5-25'>&nbsp;</a>The Abhidhammattha Sangaha, the authorship of which is attributed to 
venerable Anuruddha Thera, an Indian monk of Kanjevaram (Kāñcipura), gives an 
epitome of the entire Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is still the most fitting 
introduction to Abhidhamma. By mastering this book, a general knowledge of 
Abhidhamma may easily be acquired. </p>

<p><a name='5-26' href='?#5-26'>&nbsp;</a>To be a master of Abhidhamma all the seven books, together with commentaries 
and sub-commentaries, have to be read and re-read patiently and critically. </p>

<p><a name='5-27' href='?#5-27'>&nbsp;</a>Abhidhamma is not a subject of fleeting interest designed for the superficial 
reader. </p>

<p><a name='5-28' href='?#5-28'>&nbsp;</a>To the wise truth-seekers, Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide and an 
intellectual treat. Here there is food for thought to original thinkers and to 
earnest students who wish to increase their wisdom and lead an ideal Buddhist 
life.</p>

<p><a name='5-29' href='?#5-29'>&nbsp;</a>However, to the superficial, Abhidhamma must appear as dry as dust. </p>

<p><a name='5-30' href='?#5-30'>&nbsp;</a>It may be questioned, &quot;Is Abhidhamma absolutely essential to realize Nibbāna, 
the summum bonum of Buddhism, or even to comprehend things as they truly are?&quot; </p>

<p><a name='5-31' href='?#5-31'>&nbsp;</a>Undoubtedly Abhidhamma is extremely helpful to comprehend fully the word of 
the Buddha and realize Nibbāna, as it presents a key to open the door of 
reality. It deals with realities and a practical way of noble living, based on 
the experience of those who have understood and realized. Without a knowledge of 
the Abhidhamma one at times&#39; finds it difficult to understand the real 
significance of some profound teachings of the Buddha. To develop Insight <i>
(vipassanā) </i>Abhidhamma is certainly very useful.
</p>

<p><a name='5-32' href='?#5-32'>&nbsp;</a>But one cannot positively assert that Abhidhamma is absolutely necessary to 
gain one&#39;s Deliverance. </p>

<p><a name='5-33' href='?#5-33'>&nbsp;</a>Understanding or realization is purely personal <i>(sanditthika).</i>
The four Noble Truths that form the foundation of the Buddha&#39;s teaching are 
dependent on this one fathom body. The Dhamma is not apart from oneself. Look 
within, Seek thyself. Lo, the truth will unfold itself. </p>

<p><a name='5-34' href='?#5-34'>&nbsp;</a>Did not sorrow-afflicted Patācārā, who lost her dear and near ones, realize 
Nibbāna; reflecting on the disappearance of water that washed her feet? </p>

<p><a name='5-35' href='?#5-35'>&nbsp;</a>Did not Cūlapanthaka, who could not memorize a verse even for four months, 
attain Arahantship by comprehending the impermanent nature of a clean 
handkerchief that he was handling, gazing at the sun? </p>

<p><a name='5-36' href='?#5-36'>&nbsp;</a>Did not Upatissa, later venerable Sāriputta Thera, realize Nibbāna, on 
hearing half a stanza relating to cause and effect? </p>

<p><a name='5-37' href='?#5-37'>&nbsp;</a>To some a fallen withered leaf alone was sufficient to attain Pacceka Buddha 
hood.</p>

<p><a name='5-38' href='?#5-38'>&nbsp;</a>It was mindfulness on respiration <i>(ānāpāna-sati) </i>that acted as the 
basis for the Bodhisatta to attain Buddha hood. </p>

<p><a name='5-39' href='?#5-39'>&nbsp;</a>To profound thinkers, a slight indication is sufficient to discover great 
truths. </p>

<p><a name='5-40' href='?#5-40'>&nbsp;</a>According to some scholars, Abhidhamma is not a teaching of the Buddha, but 
is a later elaboration of scholastic monks. </p>

<p><a name='5-41' href='?#5-41'>&nbsp;</a>Tradition, however, attributes the nucleus of the Abhidhamma to the Buddha 
Himself. </p>

<p><a name='5-42' href='?#5-42'>&nbsp;</a>Commentators state that the Buddha, as a mark of gratitude to His mother who 
was born in a celestial plane, preached the Abhidhamma to His mother Deva and 
others continuously for three months. The principal topics <i>(mātikā)</i> of 
the advanced teaching such as moral states<i> (kusalā dhammā), </i>immoral 
states <i>(akusalā dhammā) </i>and indeterminate states <i>(abyākatā dhammā), </i>
etc., were taught by the Buddha to venerable Sāriputta Thera, who subsequently 
elaborated them in the six books (Kathāvatthu being excluded) that comprise the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka. </p>

<p><a name='5-43' href='?#5-43'>&nbsp;</a>Whoever the great author or authors of the Abhidhamma may have been, it has 
to be admitted that he or they had intellectual genius comparable only to that 
of the Buddha. This is evident from the intricate and subtle Patthāna Pakarana 
which minutely describes the various causal relations. </p>

<p><a name='5-44' href='?#5-44'>&nbsp;</a>It is very difficult to suggest an appropriate English equivalent for 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p><a name='5-45' href='?#5-45'>&nbsp;</a>There are many technical terms, too, in Abhidhamma which cannot be rendered 
into English so as to convey their exact connotation. Some English equivalents 
such as consciousness, will, volition, intellect, perception are used in a 
specific sense in Western Philosophy. Readers should try to understand in what 
sense these technical terms are employed in Abhidhamma. To avoid any 
misunderstanding, due to preconceived views, Pāli words, though at times 
cumbersome to those not acquainted with the language, have judiciously been 
retained wherever the English renderings seem to be inadequate. To convey the 
correct meaning implied by the Pāli terms, the etymology has been given in many 
instances. </p>

<p><a name='5-46' href='?#5-46'>&nbsp;</a>At times Pāli technical terms have been used in preference to English 
renderings so that the reader may be acquainted with them and not get confused 
with English terminology. </p>

<p><a name='5-47' href='?#5-47'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes readers will come across unusual words such as corruption, 
defilement, volitional activities, functional, resultants, and so forth, which 
are of great significance from an Abhidhamma standpoint. Their exact meaning 
should be clearly understood.</p>

<p><a name='5-48' href='?#5-48'>&nbsp;</a>In preparing this translation, Buddhist Psychology by Mrs. Rhys Davids and 
the Compendium of Philosophy (Abhidhammattha Sangaha) by Mr. Shwe Zan Aung 
proved extremely helpful to me. Liberty has been taken to quote them wherever 
necessary with due acknowledgment.</p>

<p><a name='5-49' href='?#5-49'>&nbsp;</a>My grateful thanks are due to the Kandy Buddhist Publication Society for the 
printing of this fourth revised volume, to the printers for expediting the 
printing, to Miss Rañjani Goonatilaka for correcting the proofs, and to Ven. 
Bhikkhu Bodhi for his useful suggestions. </p>

<p><a name='5-50' href='?#5-50'>&nbsp;</a>Above all I have to thank Mr. Lankatilaka, a most distinguished artist of Sri 
Lanka, for his beautiful and symbolical dust jacket design. </p>
