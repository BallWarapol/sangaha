<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. The seventy-two kinds of entities (1) have (already) been described with 
their characteristics. Now I shall speak of their categories in accordance with 
their relations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 2. The compendium of categories should be understood as fourfold: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The compendium of immoral categories. </p>
  <p>The compendium of mixed categories</p>
  <p>The compendium of categories that pertain to enlightenment. </p>
  <p>The miscellaneous compendium. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial"><b></p>

<p>(Immoral Categories)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>(i) To begin with, in the immoral compendium there are four Defilements (2): </p>

<p>1. Sense-desires, 2. Attachment to existence, 3. False Views, and 4. 
Ignorance. </p>

<p>(ii) There are four Floods (3): (same as 1-4). </p>

<p>(iii) There are four Bonds (4): (same as 1-4). </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(iv) There are four (bodily) Ties (5): 1. Covetousness, 2. Ill will, 3. 
	Adherence to rites and ceremonies, 4. Dogmatic belief that &#39;this alone is 
	truth&#39;. </p>
    <p>(v) There are four Graspings (6): 1. Sense-desires, 2. False views, 3. 
	Adherence to rites and ceremonies, 4. Soul-theory (7). </p>
    <p>(vi) There are six Hindrances (8): 1. to Sense-desires, 2- Ill will, 3. 
	Sloth and Torpor, 4. Restlessness and Brooding, 5. Doubts, 6. Ignorance. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(vii) There are seven Latent Dispositions (9):</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Attachment to sensual pleasures, 2. Attachment to existence, 3. 
	Hatred, 4. Pride, 5. False Views, 6. Doubts, and 7. Ignorance. </p>
    <p>(viii) There are ten Fetters according to the Suttas (10): 1. Attachment 
	to sensual pleasures, 2. Attachment to Realms of Form, 3. Attachment to 
	Formless Realms, 4. Hatred, 5. Pride, 6. False Views, 7. Adherence to rites 
	and ceremonies, 8. Doubts, 9. Restlessness, and 10. Ignorance. </p>
    <p>(ix) There are ten other Fetters according to Abhidhamma: 1. Attachment 
	to sensual pleasures, 2. Attachment to existence, 3. Hatred, 4. Pride, 5. 
	False Views, 6. Adherence to rites and ceremonies, 7. Doubts, 8. Envy, 9. 
	Avarice, and 10. Ignorance. </p>
    <p>(x) There are ten Impurities (11): 1. Greed, 2. Hate, 3. Delusion, 4. 
	Pride, 5. False Views, 6. Doubts, 7. Sloth, 8. Restlessness, 9. Moral 
	Shamelessness, and 10. Moral Fearlessness (unscrupulousness). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Herein in the category of Defilements and so on the terms &#39;attachment to 
sensual pleasures&#39; and &#39;attachment to existence&#39; imply craving based on them. In 
the same way &#39;adherence to rites and ceremonies&#39;, dogmatic belief that &#39;this 
alone is truth&#39;, and &#39;clinging to the soul-theory&#39; connote just &#39;false views&#39; 
connected therewith. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually Defilements, Floods, Bonds, and Ties are threefold. There are two 
Graspings and eight Hindrances. Latent Dispositions are six. Fetters should be 
understood as nine. Impurities are ten. This compendium of immoral categories 
(12) is ninefold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Vatthudhammā</b> - namely, 72. (1+52 +18 +1=72)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a. 1 - All the 89 types of consciousness are regarded as one as they 
		all possess the characteristic of &#39;awareness&#39;. </p>
        <p>b. 52 - All mental states <i>(cetasikas)</i> are viewed separately as 
		they possess different characteristics. </p>
        <p>c. 18 - All the conditioned <i>(nipphanna) rūpas</i> are considered 
		separately since they differ in their characteristics. </p>
        <p>d. 1 - Nibbāna is one inasmuch as it possesses the characteristic of 
		peacefulness. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>All these 72 are subjective and objective realities described in the previous 
chapters. They are miscellaneously treated in this chapter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>āsava</b> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
su,</i> to flow. They are so called either because they flow up to the topmost 
plane of existence or because they persist as far as the <i>gotrabhū</i> 
consciousness (i.e., the thought-moment that immediately precedes the 
Path-consciousness of the &#39;Stream-winner&#39; - sotāpatti). These <i>āsavas</i> are 
latent in all worldlings and may rise to the surface in any plane of existence. 
They lie dormant in all from an indefinite period and are treated as strong 
intoxicants or drugs that infatuate beings. Defilements, Corruptions, 
Depravities, Taints, Intoxicants, Stains, are suggested as the closest 
equivalents for this &#39;infamously famous&#39; Pāli term. See Compendium p. 170, n. 1; 
p. 227. </p>

<p>Of the four <i>āsavas, kāmāsava</i> means attachment to sensual pleasures, <i>
bhavāsava</i> is attachment to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> planes of existence, <i>
ditthāsava</i> are the sixty-two kinds of erroneous views, (see Digha Nikāya 1) 
and <i>avijjāsava</i> is ignorance with regard to the four Noble Truths, past 
life, future life, both past and future lives, and the Law of Dependent Arising. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Ogha</b> is derived from <i>ava + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
han, </i>to harm or kill. Beings caught in the current of a great flood are 
overturned and swept away directly to the sea and are hurled into the bottom. In 
the same way these <i>oghas</i>
drown beings completely and sweep them away into states of misery. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Yoga</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>yuj,</i>
to yoke. <i>Yogas</i> are those that yoke beings to the round of existence or to 
the machine of existence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Ganthas</b> are those that bind mind with body or the present body with 
bodies of future existences. Here the term kāya is used in the sense of mass or 
body both mental and physical. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Upādānāni</b> is derived from <i>upa + ā <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
dā,</i> to give. Intense craving is implied by the term. Hence in the <i>
paticcasamuppāda</i>
it is stated: Because of craving <i>(tanhā)</i> there is attachment or grasping <i>
(upādāna).</i>
<i>Tanhā</i> is like a thief groping in the dark to steal some thing. Upādāna is 
like the actual stealing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Attavādūpādāna</b> - Commentaries mention twenty kinds of soul-theories 
associated with the five Aggregates as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(i) Soul is identical with the body,</p>
        <p>(ii) Soul is possessed of a body,</p>
        <p>(iii) Soul is in the body,</p>
        <p>(iv) Body is in the soul. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Four soul-theories connected with each of the remaining four Aggregates 
should be similarly understood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Nīvaranāni</b> - is derived from <i>nī + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
var,</i> to obstruct, to hinder. They are so called because they obstruct the 
way to celestial and Nibbānic bliss. According to the commentary this term means 
that which prevents the arising of good thoughts in the way of <i>jhānas,</i> 
etc., or that which does not allow the <i>jhānas</i> to arise, or that which 
obstructs the eye of wisdom. See A Manual of Buddhism, pp. 113-115, and The 
Buddha and His Teachings, pp. 539-542. </p>

<p>Usually <i>nīvaranas</i> are regarded as five, excluding ignorance. </p>

<p>Both sloth and torpor, restlessness and brooding, are grouped together 
because their functions <i>(kicca),</i> causes <i>(āhāra = hetu),</i> and their 
opposing factors are similar. The function of sloth and torpor is mental 
inactivity; that of restlessness and brooding is disquietude. The cause of the 
first pair is laziness; that of the second pair is vexation about the loss of 
relatives, etc. Energy is opposed to the first pair; tranquillity, to the second 
pair. </p>

<p>Sense-desire is compared to water mixed with various colours; ill will, to 
boiling water; sloth and torpor, to water covered with moss; restlessness and 
brooding, to perturbed water caused by wind; indecision, to turbid and muddy 
water. </p>

<p>Just as one cannot perceive one&#39;s own reflection in muddy water, even so when 
one is obsessed by Hindrances one cannot perceive what is conducive to the good 
and happiness of oneself and others. </p>

<p>These Hindrances are temporarily inhibited by the jhānas. They are completely 
eradicated by attaining, the four stages of Sainthood. Doubt or indecision is 
eradicated by attaining <i>sotāpatti;</i> sense-desire, ill will and brooding, 
by attaining Anāgāmi; sloth, torpor, and restlessness by Arahatta. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Anusaya,</b> derived from <i>anu + si, </i>to lie, to sleep, are those 
that lie dormant in oneself until an opportune moment arises for them to come to 
the surface as they have not been eradicated. All passions are <i>anusayas;</i> 
but these seven are the strongest. Every worldling who has reached the topmost <i>
jhāna</i> plane, when born amongst mankind, may give vent to these evil 
tendencies as they are latent in him. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Samyojana</b> - from <i>sam + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> yuj,</i>
to yoke, to bind, are those which bind beings to the round of existence. By 
means of the four Paths <i>(magga)</i> they are eradicated by degrees. See Ch. 
1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Kilesas</b> are those which defile or torment the mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. In the categories of evil the term <i>kāma</i> is at times applied to <i>
kāma</i>-sphere, and <i>bhava</i> to both <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> spheres. <i>
Lobha</i>
is implied by both <i>kāma-tanhā</i> and <i>bhava-tanhā.</i> Attachment to <i>
rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i>-spheres is <i>bhava-tanhā</i>. The three terms - <i>
sīlabbataparāmāsa</i>
(indulgence in rites and ceremonies), <i>idamsaccābhinivesa</i> (the dogmatic 
belief that this alone is truth) and <i>attavādūpādāna</i> (soul-theory) - 
connote <i>ditthi</i>
(false view, or error). Both <i>kāmāsava</i> and <i>bhavāsava</i> connote <i>
lobha.</i>
Strictly speaking, there are only three <i>āsavas, oghas, yogas,</i> and <i>
ganthas.</i>
Similarly there are only two <i>upādānas</i> by way of <i>lobha</i> and <i>
ditthi.</i> </p>

<p>When the two pairs - <i>thīna-middha</i> and <i>uddhacca-kukkucca</i>
- are treated as four mental states, <i>nīvaranas</i> amount to eight. When <i>
kāmarāga</i>
and <i>bhavarāga</i> are grouped in craving, <i>anusayas</i> amount to six. The 
ten <i>samyojanas</i>, according to Suttanta, are reduced to seven when <i>
kāmarāga, rūparāga, arūparāga</i>
are included in <i>lobha,</i> and <i>ditthi</i> and <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa</i> in <i>
ditthi.</i>
The ten <i>samyojanas</i> are treated as eight when <i>kāmarāga</i> and <i>
bhavarāga</i>
are included in <i>lobha,</i> and <i>ditthi</i> and <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa</i> in <i>
ditthi. Kilesas</i> are precisely ten. Thus, it will be seen, that the 14 
immoral mental states appear in different proportions in the nine categories of 
evil. <i>Lobha</i> is common to all. </p>

  <p>(vi) There are four Dominating Factors (19): 1. Intention (or Wish-to-do),

  Intellect). </p>
  <p>(vii) There are four kinds of Food (21): 1. Edible Food, 2. Contact (or 
  sense-impact), 3. Volitional activities, and 4. (Rebirth) Consciousness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, amongst the Faculties, the thought, &#39;I will realize the unknown&#39; means 
the knowledge of the Path of the Stream-Winner <i>(Sotāpanna).</i> The Faculty 
of him who has fully realized, means the knowledge of the Fruit of Arahatship. 
Highest Realization means the intermediate six kinds of knowledge. The 
controlling Faculty of vitality is twofold, physical and mental. </p>

<p>The <i>jhāna</i> constituents (22) are not obtained in the five kinds of 
sense-cognition; &#39;Forces&#39;, in effortless states (23); &#39;the Path Constituents&#39;, 
in the Rootless(24). Similarly in the consciousness accompanied by Doubts (25), 
one-pointedness does not attain to the state of a &#39;Path Constituent&#39;, 
&#39;Controlling Faculty&#39; or a &#39;Force&#39;. Only one &#39;Dominating Power&#39; (26) is obtained 
at a time, according to circumstances, and only in the <i>javana</i> 
consciousness, accompanied by two or three moral roots. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In reality six roots, five <i>jhāna</i> constituents, nine Path constituents, 
sixteen controlling factors, nine powers have been described (27). </p>

<p>Likewise four dominant factors, and four kinds of food have been told. Thus 
in seven ways has the compendium of mixed categories, consisting of moral and 
immoral states, been enumerated. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Missakasangaho</b> - This is so called because moral <i>(kusala),</i>
immoral <i>(akusala),</i> and indeterminate <i>(avyākata),</i> are mixed in this 
section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Hetu</b> - See Chapter 1, p. <a HREF="#hetu">*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Jhānanga</b> - <i>Jhāna</i> is explained as that which burns up the 
opposing conditions of Hindrances, or that which closely perceives the object. 
Both these meanings are applicable to the ecstasies, gained by mental 
concentration. The six constituents of <i>jhāna</i> are used in these two 
senses. When the same factors appear in a moral or immoral consciousness and 
&#39;displeasure&#39; appears in an immoral consciousness, they are termed <i>jhānangas</i> 
in the second general sense. Only displeasure is immoral; the rest are moral, 
immoral, and indeterminate. See Chapter 1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Maggangāni</b> - Here <i>magga</i> is used in its general sense 
namely, that which leads to the presence of blissful states, woeful states, and 
Nibbāna <i>(sugati-duggatīnam nibbānassa ca abhimukham pāpanato maggā </i>- 
Comm.). Of the twelve constituents the last four lead to woeful states; the 
rest, to the blissful states and Nibbāna.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, by these twelve constituents are meant nine mental states 
found in different types of consciousness. Of the four evil constituents, wrong 
views mean the immoral <i>ditthi cetasikā;</i> wrong thoughts, wrong effort, and 
wrong one-pointedness mean the <i>vitakka, vāyāma,</i> and <i>ekaggatā cetasikās</i>
respectively found in the immoral types of consciousness. </p>

<p>Right Understanding means the <i>paññā cetasika;</i> right thoughts, right 
effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness mean the <i>vitakka, 
vāyāma, sati</i> and <i>ekaggatā cetasikas</i> respectively, found in the moral 
and indeterminate types of consciousness. Right speech, right action, and right 
livelihood are the three Abstinences <i>(virati) </i>found collectively in the 
supramundane consciousness and separately in mundane moral types of 
consciousness. The first eight are collectively found only in the eight types of 
supramundane consciousness. By the noble Eightfold Path are meant these eight 
specific mental states. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Indriya</b> - So called because they possess a controlling power in 
their respective spheres. The first five are the sensitive organs described 
earlier. The sixth and seventh are collectively called <i>bhāvindriya.</i> 
Vitality is both physical and mental. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 represent five 
kinds of feeling. 15,16,17,18, and 19 are treated both as Faculties and Powers 
as they influence their co-adjuncts and as they overcome their opposing forces. 
The last three Faculties are very important and they pertain to the 
supramundane. By <i>anaññātam</i> is meant the Nibbāna never seen before. It is 
at the first stage of Sainthood <i>(sotāpatti)</i> that the four Truths are 
realized for the first time. Hence the knowledge of the <i>sotāpatti</i> Path is 
technically called <i>anaññātam ñassāmi&#39;t&#39;</i> <i>indriyam</i>. The intermediate 
six kinds of knowledge from the <i>sotāpatti</i> Fruit to the Arahatta Path are 
termed <i>aññā</i>
(derived from <i>ā</i> = perfect + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i> to 
know), highest knowledge. As the wisdom found in all these seven types of 
supramundane consciousness controls the coexisting 37 Factors of Enlightenment, 
it is termed <i>indriya.</i>
An Arahat is called an <i>aññātāvī</i> because he has fully realized the four 
Noble Truths. The last Faculty refers to the highest knowledge of the Arahat in 
the Fruit stage.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Balāni</b> - These nine Powers are so called because they cannot be 
shaken by the opposing forces and because they strengthen their co-adjuncts. The 
first seven are moral; the last two, immoral. The first seven, in order, are 
opposed to faithlessness, laziness, heedlessness, restlessness, ignorance, moral 
shamelessness, and moral fearlessness. The last two immoral Powers are found 
only in the immoral twelve types of consciousness and they consolidate their 
co-adjuncts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>Adhipati,</b> lit., supremacy, or lordship therein. The difference 
between <i>adhipati</i> and <i>indriya</i> should be clearly understood. <i>
Adhipati</i>
may be compared to a king who, as the sole head of the State, lords over all his 
ministers. <i>Indriyas</i> are compared to the king&#39;s ministers who control only 
their respective departments without interfering with the others. The Faculty of 
eye, for instance, controls only its coexisting <i>rūpas</i> without any 
interference with the controlling faculty of the ear. In the case of <i>
adhipati,</i> one dominates all the other coexisting factors with no resistance 
from any. No two <i>adhipatis</i> can exercise supreme authority simultaneously. <i>
Indriyas</i> can have their compeers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. Here <i>citta</i> refers to the <i>javana</i> thought-process and <i>
vimamsā</i>
to the faculty of wisdom <i>(paññindriya). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>āhāra,</b> in this connection, is used in the sense of sustenance. 
Edible food <i>(kabalīkārāhāra)</i> sustains the material body. <i>Phassāhāra</i>
or contact or sense-impact sustains the five kinds of feeling. By <i>
manosamcetanāhāra</i>
are meant the different kinds of volitions present in the 29 types of moral and 
immoral mundane consciousness. They sustain or produce rebirth in the three 
spheres. <i>Viññānāhāra</i>
signifies the rebirth-consciousness that sustains the mental states and material 
phenomena
<i>(nāma-rūpa)</i> which arise simultaneously. There are 19 such types of 
rebirth-consciousness. In the case of Mindless Spheres they sustain only <i>
rūpa;</i> in the case of Formless Spheres they sustain only nāma. In the 
existences where the five Aggregates are present they sustain both mind and 
matter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. No <i>jhāna</i> constituents are present in the 10 types of 
sense-cognitions because the sense-impressions are weak, and close perception of 
the object is absent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. Effortless states are the sixteen types of consciousness, namely, ten 
sense-cognitions, two <i>sampaticchanas</i>, three <i>santīranas</i>, and the 
sense-door consciousness <i>(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i> One-pointedness present in 
them is not very strong. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. The Rootless are the 18 <i>ahetuka-cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. The one pointedness present in the <i>vicikicchā-citta</i> serves only to 
stabilize the mind. It is not powerful. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. There are no <i>adhipatis</i> in the <i>ahetuka</i> and <i>ekahetuka 
cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. Strictly speaking, there are five <i>jhāna</i> constituents because the 
three kinds of feeling could be treated as one; path constituents are nine, 
since wrong thoughts, effort, and one-pointedness are included in <i>vitakka, 
viriya</i>
and <i>ekaggatā</i> respectively. <i>Indriyas</i> are sixteen when the five 
kinds of feelings are grouped in one, and the three supramundane in <i>paññā. </i></p>

fourteen according to their nature: Will, Thought, Equanimity, Confidence, 
Quietude, Rapture, Right Understanding, Aspirations or Thoughts, Effort, the 
three Abstinences, Right Mindfulness, and Concentration. </p>

<p>The enumeration of these 37 sublime factors is as follows: Aspirations, 
Quietude, Rapture, Equanimity, Will, Thought, the three Abstinences, occur once; 
Effort nine times; Mindfulness eight times; Concentration four times; Wisdom 
five times; Confidence twice (35). </p>

<p>All these, save at times Aspirations and Rapture, occur in the Supramundane 
(Consciousness) and in the mundane (consciousness) too, according to 
circumstances, in the course of sixfold purity. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Bodhipakkhiya</b> - Bodhi means Enlightenment or the aspirant for 
Enlightenment. <i>Pakkhiya,</i> literally, means &#39;on the side of&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Satipatthāna</b> - <i>sati</i> = mindfulness, awareness, or 
attentiveness; <i>patthāna</i> = establishment, application, foundations, bases. 
These <i>satipatthānas</i>
are intended to develop both concentration and insight. Each <i>satipatthāna</i> 
serves a specific purpose. Contemplation on these four leads, on the one hand, 
to the development of &#39;undesirableness&#39; <i>(asubha),</i> painfulness <i>
(dukkha),</i> impermanence <i>(anicca),</i>
and &#39;soullessness&#39; <i>(anattā); </i>and, on the other hand, to the eradication 
of &#39;desirableness&#39;, pleasure, permanence and substantiality. </p>

<p>Briefly, the objects of mindfulness may be divided into <i>nāma</i>
and <i>rūpa.</i> The first - which deals with <i>rūpa,</i> breath is also 
regarded as a kind of <i>rūpa.</i> The second and the third deal with different 
kinds of feelings and thoughts. The fourth deals with both <i>nāma</i> and <i>
rūpa.</i> Hence it is very difficult to render the Pāli term, Dhamma, used in 
this connection, by one English equivalent. It is preferable to retain the Pāli 
term to avoid any misunderstanding. </p>

<p>For details see the Satipatthāna Sutta and the commentary. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Sammappadhāna</b> (Right exertion) - One mental state - <i>viriya</i>
- performs four functions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Iddhipāda</b> - The means of accomplishing one&#39;s own end or purpose. 
Strictly speaking, all these four pertain to the Supramundane Consciousness. <i>
Chanda</i>
is the mental state &#39;wish-to-do&#39;. <i>Viriya</i> refers to the four Supreme 
Efforts. <i>Citta</i>
means the Supramundane Consciousness. <i>Vīmamsā</i> signifies the mental state 
of wisdom present in the Supramundane Consciousness. Only when these four are 
present in the Supramundane Consciousness are they termed <i>iddhipāda.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Indriyas</b> and <b>Balas</b> are identical though different meanings 
are attached to them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Sambojjhanga</b> - <i>Sam</i> = exalted, good; <i>bodhi</i> = 
enlightenment or one who is striving for enlightenment; <i>anga</i> = factor. 
Here <i>dhammavicaya</i>
means seeing mind and matter as they truly are. It is insight. By <i>passaddhi</i> 
are meant both <i>citta-passaddhi</i> and <i>kāya-passaddhi</i> mental states. <i>
Upekkhā</i>
does not mean hedonic indifference but mental equipoise known as <i>
tatramajjhattatā.</i>
<i>Dhammavicaya, viriya,</i> and <i>pīti</i> are opposed to <i>thīna-middha</i> 
(sloth and torpor); <i>passaddhi, samādhi,</i> and <i>upekkhā,</i> to <i>
uddhacca</i>
(restlessness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Maggangāni</b> - According to the commentaries, here <i>magga</i>
is used in two different senses, namely, &#39;that which is sought by those who 
strive for Nibbāna&#39;, or &#39;that which goes by killing the passions&#39; <i>
(nibbānatthikehi maggīyatī&#39;ti vā kilese mārento gacchatī&#39; ti maggo). </i>
Evidently this particular definition has been given to differentiate the noble 
Eightfold Path from an ordinary one. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, these eight factors connote eight mental states 
collectively found in the supramundane consciousness that has Nibbāna for its 
object.</p>

<p><b>Sammā-ditthi</b> is rendered by Right Understanding, Right Views, Right 
Beliefs, Right Knowledge. <i>Sammā-ditthi</i> is explained as the knowledge of 
the four Noble Truths. In other words, it is the understanding of one&#39;s 
personality as it really, is or of things as they truly are. According to 
Abhidhamma, it is the mental state of wisdom <i>(paññā)</i> that tends to 
eradicate ignorance <i>(avijjā).</i> It is placed first because all actions 
should be regulated by wisdom. Right Understanding leads to Right Thoughts. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-sankappa</b> is rendered by Thoughts, Aspirations, Intentions, 
Ideas. According to Abhidhamma it is the mental state of <i>vitakka</i>
(application) that directs the mind to Nibbāna, eliminating the evil thoughts of 
sense-desires <i>(kāma),</i> ill will <i>(vyāpāda)</i> and cruelty <i>(himsā), </i>
by cultivating the good thoughts of renunciation <i>(nekkhamma),</i> 
loving-kindness <i>(avyāpāda),</i>
and harmlessness <i>(avihimsā).</i> </p>

<p>The first two constituents are grouped in wisdom <i>(paññā). </i></p>

<p>Right Thoughts lead to Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood. 
These three constitute <i>sīla</i> or Morality. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-vācā</b> signifies abstinence from lying, slandering, harsh speech, 
and frivolous talk. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-kammanta</b> deals with abstinence from killing, stealing, and 
misconduct. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-jīva</b> is twofold. It deals with right livelihood of both Bhikkhus 
and laymen. The latter are prohibited from trading in arms, slaves, intoxicants, 
animals for slaughter, and poison. </p>

<p>The three mental states of &#39;Abstinences&#39; <i>(virati)</i> are implied by these 
three constituents. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-vāyāma</b> signifies the four Supreme Efforts mentioned above. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-sati</b> denotes the four kinds of Mindfulness mentioned above. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-samādhi</b> is concentration or the &#39;one pointedness of the mind&#39;. 
It is the mental state of <i>&#39;ekaggatā&#39;. </i></p>

<p>The last three are included in <i>samādhi</i> or concentration. </p>

<p>The eight constituents comprise Morality, Concentration, and Wisdom or 
Insight. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. Effort <i>(viriya)</i> occurs nine times as follows: </p>

<p>4 Supreme Efforts, 1 Means of Accomplishment, 1 Controlling Factor, 1 Power, 
1 Constituent of Enlightenment, 1 Right Effort. </p>

<p>Mindfulness <i>(sati)</i> occurs eight times as follows: </p>

<p>4 Foundations of Mindfulness, 1 Controlling Factor; 1 Power, 1 Constituent of 
Enlightenment, 1 Right Mindfulness. </p>

<p>Concentration <i>(samādhi)</i> occurs four times as follows: </p>

<p>1 Controlling Factor, 1 Power, 1 Constituent of Enlightenment, and 1 Right 
Mindfulness. </p>

<p>Wisdom <i>(paññā) </i>occurs five times as follows: </p>

<p>1 Means of Accomplishment, 1 Controlling Factor 1 Power, 1 Constituent of 
Enlightenment, and 1 Right Understanding. </p>

<p>Confidence <i>(saddhā)</i> occurs twice as follows: </p>

<p>1 Controlling Factor, 1 Power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Supramundane Consciousness based on the second <i>jhāna</i>
is gained, there is no <i>vitakka.</i> When it is gained based on the fourth and 
fifth <i>jhānas,</i>
there is no <i>pīti. </i></p>

<p>These 37 factors are collectively found only in the Supramundane 
Consciousness, but in the mundane separately according to the type of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Herein sixty-nine entities comprising 52 mental states, 16 subtle matter, and 
Nibbāna, are regarded as the sphere of cognizables and the cognizable element. 
Only the sphere of mind divides itself into seven consciousness-elements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matter, feeling, perception, remaining mental states, and consciousness - 
these five are called the five Aggregates. </p>

<p>Similarly those that pertain to the three planes are regarded as Five 
Aggregates of grasping. </p>

<p>As Nibbāna lacks differentiation (such as past, present, future) it is 
excluded from the category of Aggregates. </p>

<p>Owing to the difference between doors and objects there arise (twelve) 
sense-spheres. In accordance with doors, objects, and their resultant 
consciousness arise the elements. </p>

<p>Existence in the three planes is suffering. Craving is its cause. Cessation 
is Nibbāna. Path is regarded as supramundane. </p>

<p>Mental states associated with the Paths and the Fruits are excluded from the 
four Truths. </p>

<p>Thus the category of &#39;the whole&#39; has been explained in five ways. </p>

<p>This is the seventh chapter of the Compendium of Abhidhamma dealing with the 
Abhidhamma Categories. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. Category of all such as Aggregates, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Khandha</b> means group, mass, aggregate. The Buddha analyses the 
so-called being into five groups. All the past, present, and future material 
phenomena are collectively called <i>rūpakkhandha.</i> The other four divisions 
should be similarly understood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. Here the term <b>Sankhāra</b> is used in a specific sense. Of the 52 
mental states, feeling is one, and perception is another. The remaining 50 
mental states are collectively called <i>sankhāra.</i> Mental formations, 
propensities, tendencies, syntheses, do not exactly convey the meaning of the 
Pāli term. Even &#39;volitional activities&#39; is not very appropriate. </p>

<p>&#39;Mental states&#39; is too general, but is not misleading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Upādānakkhandha.</b> They are so called because they form the objects 
of clinging or grasping. The eight supramundane states of consciousness and 
mental states found therein, and the ten material qualities not born of Kamma. 
are not treated as
<i>upādānakkhandha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>āyatana</b> means a field, sphere, basis. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41.<b>Cakkhāyatana</b> means the sensitive part of the eye which responds to 
visual stimuli. The four remaining sense-organs should be similarly understood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <b>Manāyatana</b> - There is no special organ for the mind like the 
physical organs. By mind-sphere is meant the &#39;adverting consciousness&#39; <i>
(manodvārāvajjana)</i>
together with the preceding &#39;arrest <i>bhavanga&#39;</i> <i>(bhavangupaccheda).</i> 
See Chapter 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. <b>Dhātu</b> is that which bears its own characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. <b>Dhamma-dhātu</b> is synonymous with <i>dhammāyatana</i> but differs 
from <i>dhammārammana</i> as it does not include <i>citta</i> (consciousness), <i>
paññatti</i>
(concepts), and <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> (sensitive material phenomena). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. <b>Manoviññānadhātu</b> - Of the 89 classes of consciousness 76 types of 
consciousness are regarded as mind-consciousness, excluding the tenfold 
sense-consciousness <i>(dvipañcaviññāna)</i> and the three <i>manodhātu</i> (= 
two types of receiving-consciousness and sense-door consciousness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. <b>Ariyasacca</b> - The Pāli term for truth is <i>sacca</i> which means 
that which is. Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>satya</i> which denotes an 
incontrovertible fact. The Buddha enunciates four such truths which are 
associated with so-called beings. They are called <i>ariyasaccānī</i> because 
they were discovered by the Greatest Ariya, the Buddha, who was far removed from 
passions . </p>

<p>The first truth deals with <i>dukkha</i> which, for need of a better English 
equivalent, is inappropriately rendered by suffering or sorrow. As a feeling <i>
dukkha</i>
means that which is difficult to endure. As an abstract truth <i>dukkha</i> is 
used in the sense of contemptible <i>(du) </i>emptiness <i>(kha). </i>The world 
rests on suffering - hence it is contemptible. It is devoid of any reality - 
hence it is empty or void. <i>Dukkha,</i>
therefore, means contemptible void. </p>

<p>The cause of this suffering is craving or attachment <i>(tanhā)</i>
which leads to repeated births. The third Noble Truth is Nibbāna which can be 
achieved in this life itself by the total eradication of all forms of craving. 
The fourth Truth is the Noble Eightfold Path or the Middle Way. </p>
