<p><a name='5-9' href='?#5-9'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='5-10' href='?#5-10'>&nbsp;</a>Abhidhamma, as the term implies, is the Higher Teaching of the Buddha. It 
expounds the quintessence of His profound doctrine. </p>

<p><a name='5-11' href='?#5-11'>&nbsp;</a>The Dhamma, embodied in the Sutta Pitaka, is the conventional teaching <i>
(vohāra desanā),</i> and the Abhidhamma is the ultimate teaching <i>(paramattha 
desanā)</i> </p>

<p><a name='5-12' href='?#5-12'>&nbsp;</a>In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, which constitute this complex 
machinery of man, are microscopically analyzed. Chief events connected with the 
process of birth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of the 
Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms. </p>

<p><a name='5-13' href='?#5-13'>&nbsp;</a>Modern Psychology, limited as it is comes within the scope of Abhidhamma 
inasmuch as it deals with the mind, with thoughts, thought-processes, and mental 
states but it does not admit of a psyche or a soul. Buddhism teaches a 
psychology without a psyche. </p>

<p><a name='5-14' href='?#5-14'>&nbsp;</a>If one were to read the Abhidhamma as a modern textbook on psychology, one 
would be disappointed. No attempt has here been made to solve all the problems 
that confront a modern psychologist. </p>

<p><a name='5-15' href='?#5-15'>&nbsp;</a>Consciousness is defined. Thoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from 
an ethical standpoint. All mental states are enumerated. The composition of each 
type of consciousness is set forth in detail. The description of 
thought-processes that arise through the five sense-doors and the mind-door is 
extremely interesting. Such a clear exposition of thought-processes cannot be 
found in any other psychological treatise. </p>

<p><a name='5-16' href='?#5-16'>&nbsp;</a><i>Bhavanga</i> and <i>Javana</i> thought-moments, which are explained only 
in the Abhidhamma, and which have no parallel in modern psychology, are of 
special interest to a research student in psychology. </p>

<p><a name='5-17' href='?#5-17'>&nbsp;</a>That consciousness flows like a stream, a view propounded by some modern 
psychologists like William James, becomes extremely clear to one who understands 
the Abhidhamma. It must be added that an Abhidhamma student can fully comprehend 
the <i>Anattā</i>
(No-soul) doctrine, the crux of Buddhism, which is important both from a 
philosophical and an ethical standpoint. </p>

<p><a name='5-18' href='?#5-18'>&nbsp;</a>The advent of death, process of rebirth in various planes without anything to 
pass from one life to another, the evidently verifiable doctrine of Kamma and 
Rebirth are fully explained. </p>

<p><a name='5-19' href='?#5-19'>&nbsp;</a>Giving a wealth of details about mind, Abhidhamma discusses the second factor 
of man-matter or <i>rūpa.</i> Fundamental units of matter, material forces, 
properties of matter, source of matter, relationship of mind and matter, are 
described. </p>

<p><a name='5-20' href='?#5-20'>&nbsp;</a>In the Abhidhammattha Sangaha there is a brief exposition of the Law of 
Dependent Origination, followed by a descriptive account of the Causal Relations 
that finds no parallel in any other philosophy. </p>

<p><a name='5-21' href='?#5-21'>&nbsp;</a>A physicist should not delve into Abhidhamma to get a thorough knowledge of 
physics. </p>

<p><a name='5-22' href='?#5-22'>&nbsp;</a>It should be made clear that Abhidhamma does not attempt to give a 
systematized knowledge of mind and matter. It investigates these two composite 
factors of so-called being to help the understanding of things as they truly 
are. A philosophy has been developed on these lines. Based on that philosophy, 
an ethical system has been evolved to realize the ultimate goal, Nibbāna. </p>

<p><a name='5-23' href='?#5-23'>&nbsp;</a>As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly says, Abhidhamma deals with &quot;(1) What we find (a) 
within us (b) around us and of (2) what we aspire to find.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='5-24' href='?#5-24'>&nbsp;</a>In Abhidhamma all irrelevant problems that interest students and scholars, 
but having no relation to one&#39;s Deliverance, are deliberately set aside. </p>

<p><a name='5-25' href='?#5-25'>&nbsp;</a>The Abhidhammattha Sangaha, the authorship of which is attributed to 
venerable Anuruddha Thera, an Indian monk of Kanjevaram (Kāñcipura), gives an 
epitome of the entire Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is still the most fitting 
introduction to Abhidhamma. By mastering this book, a general knowledge of 
Abhidhamma may easily be acquired. </p>

<p><a name='5-26' href='?#5-26'>&nbsp;</a>To be a master of Abhidhamma all the seven books, together with commentaries 
and sub-commentaries, have to be read and re-read patiently and critically. </p>

<p><a name='5-27' href='?#5-27'>&nbsp;</a>Abhidhamma is not a subject of fleeting interest designed for the superficial 
reader. </p>

<p><a name='5-28' href='?#5-28'>&nbsp;</a>To the wise truth-seekers, Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide and an 
intellectual treat. Here there is food for thought to original thinkers and to 
earnest students who wish to increase their wisdom and lead an ideal Buddhist 
life.</p>

<p><a name='5-29' href='?#5-29'>&nbsp;</a>However, to the superficial, Abhidhamma must appear as dry as dust. </p>

<p><a name='5-30' href='?#5-30'>&nbsp;</a>It may be questioned, &quot;Is Abhidhamma absolutely essential to realize Nibbāna, 
the summum bonum of Buddhism, or even to comprehend things as they truly are?&quot; </p>

<p><a name='5-31' href='?#5-31'>&nbsp;</a>Undoubtedly Abhidhamma is extremely helpful to comprehend fully the word of 
the Buddha and realize Nibbāna, as it presents a key to open the door of 
reality. It deals with realities and a practical way of noble living, based on 
the experience of those who have understood and realized. Without a knowledge of 
the Abhidhamma one at times&#39; finds it difficult to understand the real 
significance of some profound teachings of the Buddha. To develop Insight <i>
(vipassanā) </i>Abhidhamma is certainly very useful.
</p>

<p><a name='5-32' href='?#5-32'>&nbsp;</a>But one cannot positively assert that Abhidhamma is absolutely necessary to 
gain one&#39;s Deliverance. </p>

<p><a name='5-33' href='?#5-33'>&nbsp;</a>Understanding or realization is purely personal <i>(sanditthika).</i>
The four Noble Truths that form the foundation of the Buddha&#39;s teaching are 
dependent on this one fathom body. The Dhamma is not apart from oneself. Look 
within, Seek thyself. Lo, the truth will unfold itself. </p>

<p><a name='5-34' href='?#5-34'>&nbsp;</a>Did not sorrow-afflicted Patācārā, who lost her dear and near ones, realize 
Nibbāna; reflecting on the disappearance of water that washed her feet? </p>

<p><a name='5-35' href='?#5-35'>&nbsp;</a>Did not Cūlapanthaka, who could not memorize a verse even for four months, 
attain Arahantship by comprehending the impermanent nature of a clean 
handkerchief that he was handling, gazing at the sun? </p>

<p><a name='5-36' href='?#5-36'>&nbsp;</a>Did not Upatissa, later venerable Sāriputta Thera, realize Nibbāna, on 
hearing half a stanza relating to cause and effect? </p>

<p><a name='5-37' href='?#5-37'>&nbsp;</a>To some a fallen withered leaf alone was sufficient to attain Pacceka Buddha 
hood.</p>

<p><a name='5-38' href='?#5-38'>&nbsp;</a>It was mindfulness on respiration <i>(ānāpāna-sati) </i>that acted as the 
basis for the Bodhisatta to attain Buddha hood. </p>

<p><a name='5-39' href='?#5-39'>&nbsp;</a>To profound thinkers, a slight indication is sufficient to discover great 
truths. </p>

<p><a name='5-40' href='?#5-40'>&nbsp;</a>According to some scholars, Abhidhamma is not a teaching of the Buddha, but 
is a later elaboration of scholastic monks. </p>

<p><a name='5-41' href='?#5-41'>&nbsp;</a>Tradition, however, attributes the nucleus of the Abhidhamma to the Buddha 
Himself. </p>

<p><a name='5-42' href='?#5-42'>&nbsp;</a>Commentators state that the Buddha, as a mark of gratitude to His mother who 
was born in a celestial plane, preached the Abhidhamma to His mother Deva and 
others continuously for three months. The principal topics <i>(mātikā)</i> of 
the advanced teaching such as moral states<i> (kusalā dhammā), </i>immoral 
states <i>(akusalā dhammā) </i>and indeterminate states <i>(abyākatā dhammā), </i>
etc., were taught by the Buddha to venerable Sāriputta Thera, who subsequently 
elaborated them in the six books (Kathāvatthu being excluded) that comprise the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka. </p>

<p><a name='5-43' href='?#5-43'>&nbsp;</a>Whoever the great author or authors of the Abhidhamma may have been, it has 
to be admitted that he or they had intellectual genius comparable only to that 
of the Buddha. This is evident from the intricate and subtle Patthāna Pakarana 
which minutely describes the various causal relations. </p>

<p><a name='5-44' href='?#5-44'>&nbsp;</a>It is very difficult to suggest an appropriate English equivalent for 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p><a name='5-45' href='?#5-45'>&nbsp;</a>There are many technical terms, too, in Abhidhamma which cannot be rendered 
into English so as to convey their exact connotation. Some English equivalents 
such as consciousness, will, volition, intellect, perception are used in a 
specific sense in Western Philosophy. Readers should try to understand in what 
sense these technical terms are employed in Abhidhamma. To avoid any 
misunderstanding, due to preconceived views, Pāli words, though at times 
cumbersome to those not acquainted with the language, have judiciously been 
retained wherever the English renderings seem to be inadequate. To convey the 
correct meaning implied by the Pāli terms, the etymology has been given in many 
instances. </p>

<p><a name='5-46' href='?#5-46'>&nbsp;</a>At times Pāli technical terms have been used in preference to English 
renderings so that the reader may be acquainted with them and not get confused 
with English terminology. </p>

<p><a name='5-47' href='?#5-47'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes readers will come across unusual words such as corruption, 
defilement, volitional activities, functional, resultants, and so forth, which 
are of great significance from an Abhidhamma standpoint. Their exact meaning 
should be clearly understood.</p>

<p><a name='5-48' href='?#5-48'>&nbsp;</a>In preparing this translation, Buddhist Psychology by Mrs. Rhys Davids and 
the Compendium of Philosophy (Abhidhammattha Sangaha) by Mr. Shwe Zan Aung 
proved extremely helpful to me. Liberty has been taken to quote them wherever 
necessary with due acknowledgment.</p>

<p><a name='5-49' href='?#5-49'>&nbsp;</a>My grateful thanks are due to the Kandy Buddhist Publication Society for the 
printing of this fourth revised volume, to the printers for expediting the 
printing, to Miss Rañjani Goonatilaka for correcting the proofs, and to Ven. 
Bhikkhu Bodhi for his useful suggestions. </p>

<p><a name='5-50' href='?#5-50'>&nbsp;</a>Above all I have to thank Mr. Lankatilaka, a most distinguished artist of Sri 
Lanka, for his beautiful and symbolical dust jacket design. </p>

<p><a name='6-4' href='?#6-4'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-5' href='?#6-5'>&nbsp;</a>1. <b>Abhidhammattha-Sangaha</b> is the name of the book. Abhidhamma, 
literally, means &quot;Higher Doctrine&quot;. <em>Attha</em> here means &quot;things&quot;. <em>
Sangaha</em> means &quot;a compendium&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='6-6' href='?#6-6'>&nbsp;</a>The prefix &quot;<em>abhi</em>&quot; is used in the sense of preponderant, great, 
excellent, sublime, distinct, etc. </p>

<p><a name='6-7' href='?#6-7'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-8' href='?#6-8'>&nbsp;</a>2. <b>Dhamma</b> is a multi-significant term, derived from the root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>dhar,</i> to hold, to support. Here the Pāli term is used in the 
sense of doctrine or teaching. According to the Atthasālini, &quot;<i>abhi</i>&quot; 
signifies either &quot;<i>atireka</i>&quot; -higher, greater, exceeding - or &quot;<i>visittha</i>&quot; 
- distinguished, distinct, special, sublime. </p>

<p><a name='6-9' href='?#6-9'>&nbsp;</a>Abhidhamma means the Higher Doctrine because it enables one to achieve one&#39;s 
Deliverance, or because it exceeds the teachings of the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya 
Pitaka. </p>

<p><a name='6-10' href='?#6-10'>&nbsp;</a>In the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka the Buddha has used conventional terms 
such as man, animal, being, and so on. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka, on the 
contrary, everything is microscopically analyzed and abstract terms are used. As 
a distinction is made with regard to the method of treatment, it is called 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p><a name='6-11' href='?#6-11'>&nbsp;</a>Thus, chiefly owing to the preponderance of the teachings, or because it is 
conducive to one&#39;s Deliverance, and owing to the excellent analytical method of 
treatment, it is called Abhidhamma. </p>

<p><a name='6-12' href='?#6-12'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-13' href='?#6-13'>&nbsp;</a>3. The <b>Abhidhamma Pitaka</b> consists of seven treatises - namely, </p>

<h3>iv. <b>Puggalapaññatti</b> - &quot;Designation of Individuals&quot;.</h3>

<p><a name='6-55' href='?#6-55'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-56' href='?#6-56'>&nbsp;</a>In the method of exposition this book resembles the Anguttara Nikāya of the 
Sutta Pitaka. Instead of dealing with various Dhammas, it deals with various 
types of individuals. There are ten chapters in this book. The first chapter 
deals with single individuals, the second with pairs, the third with groups of 
three, etc. In extent it exceeds five Bhānavāras (40,000 letters). </p>

<h3>v. <b>Kathāvatthu</b> - &quot;Points of Controversy&quot;</h3>

<p><a name='6-57' href='?#6-57'>&nbsp;</a>The authorship of this treatise is ascribed to Venerable Moggalliputta Tissa 
Thera, who flourished in the time of King Dhammāsoka. It was he who presided at 
the third Conference held at Pātalaliputta (Patna) in the 3rd century B.C. This 
work of his was included in the Abhidhamma Pitaka at that Conference. </p>

<p><a name='6-58' href='?#6-58'>&nbsp;</a>The Atthasālini Commentary states that it contains one thousand Suttas: five 
hundred orthodox and five hundred heterodox. In extent it is about the size of 
the Dīgha Nikāya. </p>

<p><a name='6-59' href='?#6-59'>&nbsp;</a>This book deals with 216 controversies and is divided into 23 chapters.

<h3>vi. <b>Yamaka</b> - &quot;The Book of Pairs&quot;. </h3>

<p><a name='6-60' href='?#6-60'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-61' href='?#6-61'>&nbsp;</a>It is so called owing to its method of treatment. Throughout the book a 
question and its converse are found grouped together. For instance, the first 
pair of the first chapter of the book, which deals with roots, runs as follows: 
Are all wholesome Dhammas wholesome roots? And are all wholesome roots wholesome 
Dhammas? </p>

<p><a name='6-62' href='?#6-62'>&nbsp;</a>This book is divided into ten chapters - namely, </p>

<h3>vii. <b>Patthāna</b> - &quot;The Book of Causal Relations&quot;. </h3>

<p><a name='6-74' href='?#6-74'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-75' href='?#6-75'>&nbsp;</a>This is the most important and the most voluminous book of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. One who patiently reads this treatise cannot but admire the profound 
wisdom and penetrative insight of the Buddha. There is no doubt of the fact that 
to produce such an elaborate and earned treatise one must certainly be an 
intellectual genius. </p>

<p><a name='6-76' href='?#6-76'>&nbsp;</a>The term Patthāna is composed of the prefix &quot;pa&quot;, various and &quot;thāna&quot;, 
relation or condition <i>(paccaya).</i> It is so called because it deals with 
the 24 modes of causal relations (explained in a subsequent chapter) and the 
triplets <i>(tika)</i> and couplets <i>(duka)</i> already mentioned in the 
Dhammasangani, and which comprise the essence of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. </p>

<p><a name='6-77' href='?#6-77'>&nbsp;</a>The importance attached to this treatise, also known as &quot;Mahā Pakarana&quot;, the 
Great Book, could be gauged by the words of the Atthasālini which states: &quot;And 
while He contemplated the contents of the Dhammasangani His body did not emit 
rays, and similarly with the contemplation of the next five books. But, when 
coming to the Great Book, He began to contemplate the 24 universal causal 
relations of condition of presentation, and so on, His omniscience certainly 
found its opportunity therein.* </p>

<p><a name='6-87' href='?#6-87'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Realities</b> - There are two realities - apparent and ultimate. 
Apparent reality is ordinary conventional truth <i>(sammuti-sacca).</i> Ultimate 
reality is abstract truth <i>(paramattha-sacca). </i></p>

<p><a name='6-88' href='?#6-88'>&nbsp;</a>For instance, the smooth surface of the table we see is apparent reality. In 
an ultimate sense the apparent surface consists of forces and qualities or in 
other words, vibrations. </p>

<p><a name='6-89' href='?#6-89'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-90' href='?#6-90'>&nbsp;</a>For ordinary purposes a scientist would use the term water, but in the 
laboratory he would say H2O. In the same way the Buddha in the Sutta Pitaka 
resorts to conventional usage such as man, woman, being, self, etc., but in the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka He adopts a different mode of expression. Here He employs the 
analytical method and uses abstract terms such as aggregates <i>(khandha),</i> 
elements <i>(dhātu),</i> bases <i>(āyatana),</i>
etc. </p>

<p><a name='6-91' href='?#6-91'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-92' href='?#6-92'>&nbsp;</a>The word <i>paramattha</i> is of great significance in Abhidhamma. It is a 
compound formed of <i>parama</i> and <i>attha.</i> <i>Parama</i> is explained as 
immutable <i>(aviparīta), </i>abstract (<i>nibbattita);</i> <i>attha</i> means 
thing. <i>Paramattha,</i>
therefore, means immutable or abstract thing. Abstract reality may be suggested 
as the closest equivalent. Although the term immutable is used here it should 
not be understood that all <i>paramattha</i> are eternal or permanent. </p>

<p><a name='6-93' href='?#6-93'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-94' href='?#6-94'>&nbsp;</a>A brass vessel, for example, is not <i>paramattha.</i> It changes every 
moment and may be transmuted into a vase. Both these objects could be analyzed 
and reduced into fundamental material forces and qualities, which, in 
Abhidhamma, are termed <i>rūpa paramattha.</i> They are also subject to change, 
yet the distinctive characteristics of these <i>rūpas</i> are identically the 
same whether they are found in a vessel or a vase. They preserve their identity 
in whatever combination they are found - hence the commentarial interpretation 
of <i>parama</i> as immutable or real. <i>Attha</i> exactly corresponds to the 
English multi-significant term &quot;thing&quot;. It is not used in the sense of &quot;meaning&quot; 
here. </p>

<p><a name='6-95' href='?#6-95'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-96' href='?#6-96'>&nbsp;</a>There are four such <i>paramattha</i> or abstract realities. These four 
embrace everything that is mundane or supra mundane. </p>

<p><a name='6-97' href='?#6-97'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-98' href='?#6-98'>&nbsp;</a>The so-called being is mundane. Nibbāna is supra mundane. The former is 
composed of <i>nāma</i> and <i>rūpa.</i> According to Abhidhamma <i>rūpa</i>
connotes both fundamental units of matter and material changes as well. As such 
Abhidhamma enumerates 28 species of matter. These will be dealt with in a 
subsequent chapter. <i>Nāma,</i>
denotes both consciousness and mental states. The second chapter of this book 
deals with such mental states <i>(cetasikas)</i> which are 52 in number. One of 
these is <i>vedanā</i>
(feeling). Another is <i>saññā</i> (perception). The remaining 50 are 
collectively called <i>sankhāra</i> (mental states). The receptacle of these 
mental properties is <i>viññāna</i>
(consciousness), which is the subject-matter of this present chapter. </p>

<p><a name='6-99' href='?#6-99'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-100' href='?#6-100'>&nbsp;</a>According to the above analysis the so-called being is composed of five 
Groups or Aggregates <i>(pañcakkhandha):</i>- <i>rūpa</i> (matter), <i>vedanā</i>
(feeling), <i>saññā</i> (perception), s<i>ankhāra</i> (mental states) and <i>
viññāna</i>
(consciousness). </p>

<p><a name='6-101' href='?#6-101'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-102' href='?#6-102'>&nbsp;</a>Consciousness, mental states (with the exception of 8 types of supra mundane 
consciousness and their adjuncts), and matter are Mundane<i> (lokiya),</i> and 
Nibbāna is Supra mundane <i>(lokuttara).</i> The Supra mundane Nibbāna is the 
only absolutely reality, which is the summum bonum of Buddhism. The other three 
are called realities in that they are things that exist <i>(vijjamāna dhammā).</i> 
Besides, they are irreducible, immutable, and abstract things. They deal with 
what is within us and around us. </p>

<p><a name='6-103' href='?#6-103'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-104' href='?#6-104'>&nbsp;</a>The first <i>paramattha</i> or reality is <i>citta.</i> It is derived from 
the root <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>citi,</i> to think. According to the 
commentary <i>citta</i> is that which is aware of <i>(cinteti = vijānāti)</i> an 
object. It is not that which thinks of an object as the term implies. From an 
Abhidhamma standpoint <i>citta</i> may better be defined as the awareness of an 
object, since there is no agent like a soul. </p>

<p><a name='6-105' href='?#6-105'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-106' href='?#6-106'>&nbsp;</a><b>Citta, ceta, cittuppāda, nāma, mana, viññāna</b> are all used as 
synonymous terms in Abhidhamma. Hence from the Abhidhamma standpoint no 
distinction is made between mind and consciousness. When the so-called being is 
divided into its two constituent parts, <i>nāma</i> (mind) is used. When it is 
divided into five aggregates<i>
(pañcakkhandha), viññāna</i> is used. The term <i>citta</i> is invariably 
employed while referring to different classes of consciousness. In isolated 
cases, in the ordinary sense of mind, both terms <i>citta</i> and <i>mana</i> 
are frequently used. </p>

<p><a name='6-114' href='?#6-114'>&nbsp;</a>5. <b>Kāma</b> is either subjective sensual craving or sensuous objects such 
as forms, sound, odor, taste, and contact. By <i>kāma</i> is also meant the

<p><a name='6-116' href='?#6-116'>&nbsp;</a><b>Avacara</b> means that which moves about or that which frequents. <i>
Kāmāvacara,</i>
therefore, means that which mostly moves about in the sentient realm, or that

types of consciousness arise mostly in the aforesaid sentient existence. They 
are found in other spheres of life as well when objects of sense are perceived

developing <i>jhānas</i>

such as earth, water, fire, etc. </p>

<p><a name='6-123' href='?#6-123'>&nbsp;</a><i>Arūpalokas</i> are planes without material bodies. By the power of

<p><a name='6-194' href='?#6-194'>&nbsp;</a>8. <b>Akusala, Kusala, Vipāka, Kiriya- </b></p>

<p><a name='6-195' href='?#6-195'>&nbsp;</a>In the previous section consciousness was broadly classified under four 
divisions according to the planes in which it is experienced. With respect to 
its nature it divides itself into four classes. Some types of consciousness are 
immoral <i>(akusala),
</i>because they spring from attachment <i>(lobha),</i> aversion or ill-will <i>
(patigha),</i>
and ignorance <i>(moha).</i> Opposed to them are the moral types of 
consciousness<i>
(kusala), </i>because they are rooted in non-attachment or generosity <i>
(alobha),</i>
goodwill <i>(adosa), </i>and wisdom <i>(amoha).</i> The former are unwholesome 
as they produce undesirable effects <i>(anittha vipāka), </i>the latter are 
wholesome as they produce desirable effects <i>(ittha vipāka).</i> Both <i>
kusala</i> and <i>akusala cittas</i>
constitute what, in Pāli, are termed <i>kamma.</i> Those types of consciousness 
that arise as the inevitable results of these <i>kusala</i> and <i>akusala 
cittas</i> are called <i>vipāka</i> (resultant) <i>cittas.</i> It should be 
understood that both <i>kamma</i>
and <i>vipāka</i> are purely mental. The fourth type of consciousness is called <i>
kiriya</i>
which, for want of a better term, is rendered by &quot;karmically ineffective&quot;, 
&quot;inoperative&quot; or &quot;functional&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='6-198' href='?#6-198'>&nbsp;</a>9. <b>Three Roots (Mūla)-</b> </p>

<p><a name='6-199' href='?#6-199'>&nbsp;</a><i>Lobha, dosa,</i> and <i>moha</i> are the three roots of evil. Their 
opposites are the roots of good. </p>

<p><a name='6-200' href='?#6-200'>&nbsp;</a><i>Lobha,</i> from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lubh,</i> to cling, or 
attach itself, may be rendered by &#39;attachment&#39; or &#39;clinging&#39;. Some scholars 
prefer &#39;greed&#39;. Craving is also used as an equivalent of <i>lobha. </i></p>

<p><a name='6-201' href='?#6-201'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of a desirable object of sense, there arises, as a rule, clinging 
or attachment. In the case of an undesirable object, ordinarily there is 
aversion. </p>

<p><a name='6-202' href='?#6-202'>&nbsp;</a>In Pāli such aversion is termed <i>dosa</i> or <i>patigha. Dosa</i> is 
derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dus,</i> to be displeased. <i>
Patigha</i> is derived from <i>&#39;pati&#39;,</i> against, and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>
&#39;gha&#39; (han),</i>
to strike, to contact. Ill-will, hatred are also suggested as equivalents of <i>
&#39;patigha&#39;.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='6-203' href='?#6-203'>&nbsp;</a><i>Moha</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muh,</i>
to delude. It is delusion, stupidity, bewilderment. It is <i>&#39;moha&#39;</i> that 
clouds an object and blinds the mind. Sometimes <i>&#39;moha&#39;</i> is rendered by 
ignorance. </p>

<p><a name='6-204' href='?#6-204'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma, <i>moha</i> is common to all evil. <i>Lobha</i>
and <i>dosa</i> do not arise alone, but always in combination with <i>moha. 
Moha,</i> on the other hand, does arise singly-hence the designation <i>
&#39;momūha&#39;,</i> intense delusion. </p>

<p><a name='6-205' href='?#6-205'>&nbsp;</a>Diametrically opposed to the above three roots are the roots of <i>kusala.</i>
They not only indicate the absence of certain evil conditions, but also signify 
the presence of certain positive good conditions. <i>Alobha</i> does not merely 
mean non-attachment, but also generosity. <i>Adosa</i> does not merely mean 
non-anger or non-hatred, but also goodwill, or benevolence, or loving-kindness <i>
(mettā). Amoha </i>does not merely mean non-delusion, but also wisdom or 
knowledge <i>(ñāna</i> or <i>paññā).

<p><a name='6-208' href='?#6-208'>&nbsp;</a>10. <b>Vedanā or Feeling-</b> </p>

<p><a name='6-209' href='?#6-209'>&nbsp;</a><a NAME="MORCON5"></a>Feeling or, as some prefer to say, sensation, is a 
mental state common to all types of consciousness. Chiefly there are three kinds 
of feelings -namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>somanassa</i> (pleasurable), </li>
  <li> <i>domanassa</i> (displeasurable),
  </li>
  <li> <i>upekkhā</i> (indifferent, neutral, equanimity or neither pleasurable 
  nor dis-pleasurable). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='6-210' href='?#6-210'>&nbsp;</a>With </p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>dukkha</i> (physical pain) </li>
  <li> <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness) </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='6-211' href='?#6-211'>&nbsp;</a>there are altogether five kinds of feelings. </p>

<p><a name='6-212' href='?#6-212'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-213' href='?#6-213'>&nbsp;</a><i>Somanassa</i> is an abstract noun formed of <i>&#39;su&#39;,</i> good, and <i>
&#39;mana&#39;,</i>
mind. Literally, the term means good-mindedness, i.e., a pleasurable feeling.  </p>

<p><a name='6-214' href='?#6-214'>&nbsp;</a>Similarly <i>&#39;domanassa&#39;</i>
<i>(&#39;du&#39;,</i> bad, and <i>&#39;mana&#39;,</i> mind) means bad-mindedness i.e., a 
dis-pleasurable feeling.  </p>

<p><a name='6-215' href='?#6-215'>&nbsp;</a>The third feeling is neutral. Indifference is used here in this particular 
sense, but not in the sense of callousness. <i>Sukha</i> is composed of <i>&#39;su&#39;,</i> 
easy, and <i>&#39;kha&#39;</i>
to bear, or to endure. What is easily endured is <i>&#39;sukha&#39;</i> i.e., happiness. <i>
Dukkha (du,</i> difficult), pain, is that which is difficult to be endured. Both 
these sensations are physical.  </p>

<p><a name='6-216' href='?#6-216'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma there is only one type of consciousness accompanied 
by pain, and one accompanied by happiness. Two are connected with a 
dis-pleasurable feeling. Of the 89 types of consciousness, in the remaining 85 
are found either a pleasurable feeling or a neutral feeling.</p>

<p><a name='6-217' href='?#6-217'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-218' href='?#6-218'>&nbsp;</a><i>Somanassa, domanassa,</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> are purely mental. <i>Sukha</i>
and <i>dukkha</i> are purely physical. This is the reason why there is no <i>
upekkhā</i>
in the case of touch which, according to Abhidhamma, must be either happy or 
painful. (See Upekkhā,

<p><a name='6-222' href='?#6-222'>&nbsp;</a>This term is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>&#39;dis&#39;,</i>

qualified by <i>&#39;micchā&#39;,</i>
it means wrong view or wrong belief. Here the term is used without any

It is formed of <i>&#39;sam&#39;,</i> well and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>&#39;kar&#39;,</i>
to do, to prepare, to accomplish. Literally, it means accomplishing, preparing,

<p><a name='6-229' href='?#6-229'>&nbsp;</a>Like <i>dhamma, sankhāra</i> also is a multi-significant term. Its precise

invariably applied to all conditioned things. </p>

<p><a name='6-235' href='?#6-235'>&nbsp;</a>If, for instance, one does an act, induced by another, or after much

<p><a name='6-252' href='?#6-252'>&nbsp;</a>This section deals with <i>akusala</i> types of consciousness. <i>Akusala</i>
is the direct opposite of <i>kusala.</i> Atthasālini gives the etymological

as follows:- </p>

<p><a name='6-253' href='?#6-253'>&nbsp;</a>(1.) <i>ku,</i> bad, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sal,</i> to shake, to 
tremble, to destroy. That which shakes off, destroys evil or contemptible things 
is <i>kusala.</i> </p>

<p><a name='6-254' href='?#6-254'>&nbsp;</a>(2.) <i>kusa</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lu,</i> to cut. </p>

<p><a name='6-256' href='?#6-256'>&nbsp;</a>Kusa</i> is from <i>ku,</i> bad, and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>si,</i>
to lie. That which lies contemptibly is <i>kusa,</i> vice. <i>Kusala</i> is that 
which cuts off vice. </p>

<p><a name='6-257' href='?#6-257'>&nbsp;</a>(3.) a.) <i>ku,</i> evil, bad, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>su,</i>
to reduce. That which reduces or eradicates evil is <i>kusa,</i> knowledge or 
wisdom. <i>Kusa,</i>
so derived, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lu,</i> to cut. That which cuts 
off (evil) by wisdom is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p><a name='6-258' href='?#6-258'>&nbsp;</a>b.) <i>Kusa,</i> so derived, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>la,</i>

<p><a name='6-259' href='?#6-259'>&nbsp;</a>(4.) Kusa grass cuts a part of the hand with both edges. Even so <i>kusala</i>

<p><a name='6-305' href='?#6-305'>&nbsp;</a>19. <b>Killing:-</b> According to Abhidhamma killing is invariably done with 
ill-will or aversion. Prompted by whatever motive, one, as a rule, kills with a 
thought of ill-will. Where there is ill-will <i>(patigha)</i> there is 
displeasure <i>(domanassa).</i>
Where there is displeasure there is ill-will in a subtle or gross way. </p>

<p><a name='6-306' href='?#6-306'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-307' href='?#6-307'>&nbsp;</a>Suppose, for instance, a little child, who cannot discriminate between right 
and wrong, smilingly kills an ant. He does not know that he is committing the 
evil of killing. He is only playing with it. Now, does he cherish any ill-will 
towards the ant? Is there any hatred or ill-feeling in his case? It is difficult 
to say so. What type of consciousness does he experience at that moment? It 
cannot be the 9th and 10th types because he innocently does it with joy, 
fondling the object. Could it be the third type of consciousness rooted in <i>
&quot;lobha&quot;? </i></p>

<p><a name='6-308' href='?#6-308'>&nbsp;</a>An adult who kills for sport does experience the 9th or 10th type of 
consciousness. There is ill-feeling at the moment of killing. </p>

<p><a name='6-309' href='?#6-309'>&nbsp;</a>What about vivisection? A scientist may vivisect without the least 
compunction. His chief motive may be scientific investigation for consequent 
alleviation of suffering. Yet, there is the thought of killing. </p>

<p><a name='6-310' href='?#6-310'>&nbsp;</a>Does one experience ill-will when one kills a wounded animal with the object 
of putting an end to its suffering? Moved by compassion, one may do so; yet 
there is ill-will at the moment of killing, because there is a certain kind of 
aversion towards the object. If such an action is morally justifiable, could one 
object to the wholesale destruction of patients suffering from acute chronic 
incurable diseases? </p>

<p><a name='6-311' href='?#6-311'>&nbsp;</a>It was stated above that there is ill-will where there is displeasure. </p>

<p><a name='6-313' href='?#6-313'>&nbsp;</a>When, for instance, one feels sorry for having failed in an examination, does 
one harbor ill-will at that time? If one reflects on the meaning of the term <i>
patigha,</i> the answer will become clear. There is no doubt a subtle kind of 
aversion over the unpleasant news. It is the same in the case of a person who 
weeps over the death of a dear one, because it is an unwelcome event. Anāgāmis 
and Arahats never feel sorry nor grieve, because they have eradicated <i>patigha</i> 
or <i>dosa</i> (hatred or ill-will). </p>

<p><a name='6-402' href='?#6-402'>&nbsp;</a><a NAME="hetu"></a>23. <b>Hetu</b> is usually rendered by &#39;causal condition&#39;. 
In the Suttas we often come across such phrases as <i>&#39;ko hetu, ko paccayo&#39;,</i>
- &#39;what cause, what reason&#39;. In the Abhidhamma both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i> 
are differentiated and are used in specific senses. The term <i>hetu</i> is 
applied to the six roots explained above. <i>Paccaya</i> is an aiding condition<i> 
(upakāraka dhamma). </i>Like the root of a tree is hetu. <i>Paccaya</i> is like 
water, manure, etc. </p>

<p><a name='6-403' href='?#6-403'>&nbsp;</a>The aforesaid eighteen classes of consciousness are called <i>&#39;a-hetuka&#39;</i>
because they are devoid of &#39;concomitant hetus&#39; <i>(sampayuttaka hetu).</i> It 
must be understood that even <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are not devoid of an 
efficient cause <i>(nibbattaka hetu). </i>The remaining 71 classes of 
consciousness are called <i>Sa-hetuka,</i> with Roots. In two there is only one 
Root, in sixty nine there are two or three Roots. </p>

consciousness are enumerated here. They are so called because they are dependent 
on the five senses. As they are comparatively weak they are accompanied by 
neutral feeling, with the exception of body-consciousness which is accompanied 
by either pain or happiness. It should be noted that, in the Abhidhamma, these 
five pairs of consciousness are sometimes referred to as <i>&#39;dvipancaviññāna&#39;,</i> 
the two <i>sampaticchana cittas</i>
and <i>pañca-dvārāvajjana citta</i> as <i>&#39;mano dhātu&#39; </i>(mind-element), the 
rest (76) as <i>&#39;mano viññāna dhātu&#39;</i> (mind-consciousness element). </p>

receives an object. <i>Santīrana</i> is that which investigates an object. That 
moment of consciousness which turns towards one of the five sense-objects is 
called the <i>pañca-dvārāvajjana. Mano-dvārāvajjana</i> is that moment of 
consciousness which turns the mind towards a mental object. <i>
Pañca-dvārāvajjana</i> and <i>mano-dvārāvajjana</i> are the only two moments of <i>
kiriya cittas</i> experienced by those who are not Arahats. All the other <i>
kiriya cittas</i> are experienced only by Buddhas and Arahats. It is this <i>
mano-dvārāvajjana citta</i> that performs the function of <i>votthapana</i> 
(deciding) which will be dealt with later. </p>

<p><a name='6-418' href='?#6-418'>&nbsp;</a>The Compendium of Philosophy states: &quot;There are six classes of laughter 
recognized in Buddhist works: (1) <i>sita: -</i> a smile manifesting itself in 
expression and countenance; (2) <i>hasita: -</i> a smile consisting in the 
slight movements of the lips just enough to reveal the tips of the teeth; (3) <i>
vihasita: - </i>laughter giving out a light sound; (4) <i>upahasita: - </i>
laughter accompanied by the movement of the head, shoulders, and arms; (5) <i>
apahasita: - </i>laughter accompanied by the shedding of tears; and (6) <i>
atihasita: - </i>an outburst of laughter accompanied by the forward and backward 
movements of the entire body from head to foot. Laughter is thus a form of 
bodily expression<i> (kāya-viññatti),</i> which may or may not be accompanied by 
vocal expression <i>(vacī-viññatti).</i> Of these, the first two classes are 
indulged in by cultured persons, the next two by the average man, and the last 
two by the lower classes of being. </p>

<p><a name='6-423' href='?#6-423'>&nbsp;</a>The subject, the consciousness, receives objects from within and without. 
When a person is in a state of profound sleep his mind is said to be vacant, or, 
in other words, in a state of <i>bhavanga.</i> We always experience such a 
passive state when our minds do not respond to external objects. This flow of <i>
bhavanga</i> is interrupted when objects enter the mind. Then the <i>bhavanga</i> 
consciousness vibrates for one thought-moment and passes away. Thereupon the 
sense-door consciousness <i>(pañca-dvārāvajjana)</i>
arises and ceases. At this stage the natural flow is checked and is turned 
towards the object. Immediately after there arises and ceases the eye 
consciousness* <i>(cakkhu viññāna),</i> but yet knows no more about it. This 
sense operation is followed by a moment of reception of the object so seen <i>
(sampaticchana).</i> Next comes the investigating faculty <i>(santīrana)</i> or 
a momentary examination of the object so received. After this comes that stage 
of representative cognition termed the determining consciousness <i>
(votthapana). </i>Discrimination is exercised at this stage. Freewill plays its 
part here. Immediately after there arises the psychologically most important 
stage - Impulsion or <i>javana.</i> It is at this stage that an action is judged 
whether moral or immoral. <i>Kamma</i> is performed at this stage; if viewed 
rightly <i>(yoniso manasikāra),</i> the <i>javana</i> becomes moral; if viewed 
wrongly <i>(ayoniso manasikāra), </i>it becomes immoral. In the case of an 
Arahat this <i>javana</i> is neither moral nor immoral, but merely functional<i> 
(kiriya).</i> This <i>javana</i> stage usually lasts for seven thought moments, 
or, at times of death, five. The whole process which happens in an infinitesimal 
part of time ends with the registering consciousness <i>(tadālambana),</i>
lasting for two thought-moments - thus completing one thought-process at the 
expiration of seventeen thought-moments. </p>

<p><a name='6-427' href='?#6-427'>&nbsp;</a>The three kinds of <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness are <i>vipāka.</i>
They are either one of the two <i>santīrana cittas,</i> accompanied by 
indifference, mentioned above, or one of the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas,</i> 
described in section 6. <i>Pañca-dvārāvajjana</i> is a <i>kriyā citta. Pañca 
viññāna</i> is one of the ten moral and immoral <i>vipāka cittas.</i> <i>
Sampaticchana</i> and <i>santīrana</i>
are also <i>vipāka cittas.</i> The <i>mano-dvārāvajjana</i> (mind-door 
consciousness), a <i>kriyā citta,</i> functions as the <i>votthapana</i> 
consciousness. One can use one&#39;s freewill at this stage. The seven <i>javana</i> 
thought-moments constitute <i>kamma.</i>
The <i>tadālambana</i> is a <i>vipāka citta</i> which is one of the three <i>
santīrana cittas</i> or one of the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas. </i></p>

It, therefore, follows that there are sixteen <i>vipāka cittas</i> corresponding

reproductive power, since they have eradicated all fetters that bind oneself to 
existence. When they do any good act, instead of the usual <i>kusala cittas,</i> 
they experience the eight <i>kriyā cittas</i> which possess no reproductive 
energy. Ordinary persons and even Holy Ones of the first three grades of Saint

<p><a name='6-650' href='?#6-650'>&nbsp;</a>There are three planes of existence-namely, Sensuous Sphere <i>(kāmaloka),
</i>Form-Sphere <i>(rūpaloka),</i> and Formless-Sphere <i>(arūpaloka).</i> The 
four states of misery <i>(apāya),</i> human realm <i>(manussa),</i> and the six 
celestial realms <i>(devaloka)</i> constitute the <i>kāmaloka. </i>It is so 
called because sense-desires play a predominant part in this sphere. The four 
states of misery are called
<i>duggati</i> (evil states). Evil-doers are born in such states. The remaining 
seven are called <i>sugati</i> (good states). The good are born in these states 
of sensuous bliss. </p>

<p><a name='6-651' href='?#6-651'>&nbsp;</a>The more evolved persons, who seek no delight in ordinary sense-desires, but 
are interested in higher spiritual progress, must naturally be born in congenial 
places in harmony with their lofty aspirations. Even in the human realm it is 
they who retire to solitude and engage themselves in meditation. </p>

<p><a name='6-652' href='?#6-652'>&nbsp;</a>Such meditation <i>(bhāvanā)</i> is of two kinds - <i>samatha</i>
(concentration) and <i>vipassanā</i> (insight). <i>Samatha,</i> which means 
calm, or tranquillity is gained by developing the Jhānas. <i>Vipassanā</i> is 
seeing things as they truly are. With the aid of Jhānas one could develop higher 
psychic powers <i>(abhiññā).</i>
It is <i>vipassanā</i> that leads to Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='6-653' href='?#6-653'>&nbsp;</a>Those who develop Jhānas are born after death in higher Form-Spheres <i>
(rūpaloka)
</i>and Formless-spheres <i>(arūpaloka). </i></p>

<p><a name='6-654' href='?#6-654'>&nbsp;</a>In the Formless-Spheres there is no body but only mind. As a rule, both mind 
and body are interrelated, interdependent, and inseparable. But by will-power 
there is a possibility for the mind to be separated from the body and vice versa 
temporarily. Beings born in celestial realms and Form-Spheres are supposed to 
posses very subtle material forms. </p>

<p><a name='6-655' href='?#6-655'>&nbsp;</a>The Compendium of Philosophy states that &quot;<i>Rūpaloka</i> is so called 
because the subtle residuum of matter is said, in that place of existence, to be

<p><a name='6-658' href='?#6-658'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Jhāna</b> - Sanskrit <i>dhyāna</i>- </p>

<p><a name='6-659' href='?#6-659'>&nbsp;</a>The Pāli term is derived from the root <i>&quot;jhe&quot;,</i> to think. Venerable 
Buddhaghosa explains Jhāna as follows, <i>&quot;Aramman&#39;upanijjhānato 
paccanīkajhāpanato vajhanam&quot;, </i>Jhāna is so called because it thinks closely 
of an object or because it burns those adverse things (hindrances - <i>
nīvaranas).</i></p>

<p><a name='6-660' href='?#6-660'>&nbsp;</a>By Jhāna is meant willful concentration on an object. </p>

<p><a name='6-661' href='?#6-661'>&nbsp;</a>Of the forty objects of concentration, enumerated in the 9th chapter of this 
book, the aspirant selects an object that appeals most to his temperament. This 
object is called <i>parikamma nimitta</i> - preliminary object. </p>

<p><a name='6-662' href='?#6-662'>&nbsp;</a>He now intently concentrates on this object until he becomes so wholly 
absorbed in it that all adventitious thoughts get <i>ipso facto</i> excluded 
from the mind. A stage is ultimately reached when he is able to visualize the 
object even with closed eyes. On this visualized image <i>(uggaha nimitta)</i> 
he concentrates continuously until it develops into a conceptualized image <i>
(patibhāga nimitta). </i></p>

<p><a name='6-663' href='?#6-663'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-664' href='?#6-664'>&nbsp;</a>As an illustration let us take the <i>pathavī kasina.</i></p>

<p><a name='6-665' href='?#6-665'>&nbsp;</a>A circle of about one span and four inches in diameter is made and the 
surface is covered with dawn-colored clay and smoothed well. If there be not 
enough clay of the dawn color, he may put in some other kind of clay beneath. 
This hypnotic circle is known as the <i>parikamma nimitta.</i> Now he places 
this object about two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on it, 
saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavī</i> or earth. The purpose is to gain 
the one-pointedness of the mind. When he does this for some time - perhaps 
weeks, or months, or years - he would be able to close his eyes and visualize 
the object. This visualized object is called <i>uggaha nimitta.</i> Then he 
concentrates on this visualized image, which is an exact mental replica of the 
object, until it develops into a conceptualized image which is called <i>
patibhāga nimitta.</i> </p>

<p><a name='6-666' href='?#6-666'>&nbsp;</a>The difference between the first visualized image and the conceptualized 
image is that in the former the fault of the device appears, while the latter is 
clear of all such defects and is like a &quot;well-burnished conchshell&quot;. The latter 
possesses neither color nor form. &quot;It is just a mode of appearance, and is born 
of perception&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='6-667' href='?#6-667'>&nbsp;</a>As he continually concentrates on this abstract concept he is said to be in 
possession of &quot;proximate concentration&quot; <i>(upacāra samādhi) </i>and the innate 
five Hindrances to progress <i>(nīvarana),</i> such as sense-desire <i>
(kāmacchanda),</i>
hatred <i>(patigha),</i> sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha),</i> restlessness 
and brooding <i>(uddhacca-kukkucca), </i>and doubts <i>(vicikicchā)</i> are 
temporarily inhibited. </p>

<p><a name='6-668' href='?#6-668'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-669' href='?#6-669'>&nbsp;</a>Eventually he gains &quot;ecstatic concentration&quot; <i>(appanā samādhi)</i> and 
becomes enwrapped in Jhāna, enjoying the calmness and serenity of a one-pointed 
mind. </p>

<p><a name='6-670' href='?#6-670'>&nbsp;</a>As he is about to gain <i>appanā samādhi</i> a thought process runs as 
follows:- <i>bhavanga, mano-dvārāvajjana, parikamma, upacāra, anuloma, gotrabhū, 
appanā. </i></p>

<p><a name='6-671' href='?#6-671'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-672' href='?#6-672'>&nbsp;</a>When the stream of consciousness is arrested, there arises the Mind-door 
consciousness taking for its object the <i>patibhāga nimitta.</i> This is 
followed by the Javana process which, as the case may be, starts with either <i>
parikamma</i>
or <i>upacāra.</i> <i>Parikamma</i> is the preliminary or initial 
thought-moment. <i>Upacāra</i>
means proximate, because it is close to the <i>appanā samādhi.</i> It is at the <i>
anuloma</i>
or &quot;adaptation&quot; thought-moment that the mind qualifies itself for the final <i>
appanā.</i>
It is so called because it arises in conformity with <i>appanā.</i> This is 
followed by <i>gotrabhū,</i>
the thought-moment that transcends the <i>kāma</i>-plane. <i>Gotrabhū</i> means 
that which subdues <i>(bhū)</i> the Kāma-lineage <i>(gotra).</i> All the 
thought-moments of this Javana process up to the <i>gotrabhū</i> moment are <i>
kāmāvacara</i> thoughts. Immediately after this transitional stage of <i>
gotrabhū</i> there arises only for a duration of one moment the <i>appanā</i> 
thought-moment that leads to ecstatic concentration. This consciousness belongs 
to the <i>Rūpa</i>-plane, and is termed the First <i>Rūpa</i> Jhāna. In the case 
of an Arahat it is a <i>kriyā citta,</i> otherwise it is a <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p><a name='6-673' href='?#6-673'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-674' href='?#6-674'>&nbsp;</a>This consciousness lasts for one thought-moment and then subsides into the <i>
Bhavanga</i> state. </p>

<p><a name='6-675' href='?#6-675'>&nbsp;</a>The aspirant continues his concentration and develops in the foregoing manner 
the second, third, fourth, and fifth Jhānas. </p>

<p><a name='6-676' href='?#6-676'>&nbsp;</a>The five Jhāna <i>vipākas</i> are the corresponding Resultants of the five 
Morals. They are experienced in the Form sphere itself and not in the <i>Kāma</i>-sphere.
<i>Kusala</i> and <i>Kiriyā</i> Jhānas could be experienced in the <i>Kāma</i>-sphere 
continuously even for a whole day.</p>

<p><a name='6-677' href='?#6-677'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-678' href='?#6-678'>&nbsp;</a>The five factors, <i>vitakka, vicāra, pīti, sukha, ekaggatā</i>
collectively found in the <i>appanā</i> consciousness, constitute what is 
technically known as Jhāna. In the second Jhāna the first factor is eliminated, 
in the third the first two are eliminated, in the fourth the first three are 
eliminated, while in the fifth even happiness is abandoned and is substituted by 
equanimity. </p>

<p><a name='6-679' href='?#6-679'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes these five Jhānas are treated as four, as mentioned in the 
Visuddhi-Magga. In that case the second Jhāna consists of three constituents as 
both <i>vitakka</i>
and <i>vicāra</i> are eliminated at once. </p>

<p><a name='6-680' href='?#6-680'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-681' href='?#6-681'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-682' href='?#6-682'>&nbsp;</a>38. <b>Vitakka</b> - is derived from <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>
&quot;takk&quot;</i> to think. Generally the term is used in the sense of thinking or 
reflection. Here it is used in a technical sense. It is that which directs the 
concomitant states towards the object. <i>(ārammanam vitakketi sampayuttadhamme 
abhiniropeti&#39; ti vitakko).</i> Just as a king&#39;s favourite would conduct a 
villager to the palace, even so <i>vitakka</i> directs the mind towards the 
object. </p>

<p><a name='6-683' href='?#6-683'>&nbsp;</a><i>Vitakka</i> is an unmoral mental state which, when associated with a
<i>kusala</i> or <i>akusala citta,</i> becomes either moral or immoral. A 
developed form of this <i>vitakka</i> is found in the first Jhāna consciousness. 
A still more developed form of <i>vitakka</i> is found in the Path-consciousness <i>
(magga citta)</i> as <i>sammā-sankappa</i>
(Right thoughts). The <i>vitakka</i> of the Path-consciousness directs the 
mental states towards Nibbāna and destroys <i>micchā</i> (wrong or evil) <i>
vitakka</i> such as thoughts of sense-desire <i>(kāma), </i>thoughts of hatred <i>
(vyāpāda),</i> and thoughts of cruelty <i>(vihimsā).</i> The <i>vitakka</i> of 
the Jhāna consciousness temporarily inhibits sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha)</i> 
one of the five Hindrances <i>(nīvarana).</i></p>

<p><a name='6-684' href='?#6-684'>&nbsp;</a>Through continued practice the second Jhāna is obtained by eliminating
<i>vitakka.</i> When four Jhānas are taken into account instead of the five, the 
second Jhāna is obtained by eliminating both <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> at 
the same time.

<p><a name='6-687' href='?#6-687'>&nbsp;</a>39. <b>Vicāra</b> is derived from <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> + <i>&quot;car&quot;</i>
to move or wander. Its usual equivalent is investigation. Here it is used in the 
sense of sustained application of the mind on the object. It temporarily 
inhibits doubts <i>(vicikicchā).
</i></p>

<p><a name='6-688' href='?#6-688'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentary <i>vicāra</i> is that which moves around the 
object. Examination of the object is its characteristic. <i>Vitakka</i> is like 
the flying of a bee towards a flower. <i>Vicāra</i> is like its buzzing around 
it. As Jhāna factors they are correlates. </p>

<p><a name='6-691' href='?#6-691'>&nbsp;</a>40. <b>Pīti</b> is zest, joy, or pleasurable interest. It is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>&quot;pi&quot;,</i> to please, to delight. It is not a kind of feeling <i>
(vedanā)</i> like <i>sukha.</i> It is, so to say, its precursor. Like the first 
two Jhāna factors, <i>(pīti)</i> is also a mental state found in both moral and 
immoral consciousness. Creating an interest in the object is its characteristic <i>
pīti</i>
inhibits <i>vyāpāda,</i> ill-will or aversion. </p>

<p><a name='6-692' href='?#6-692'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-693' href='?#6-693'>&nbsp;</a>There are five kinds of <i>pīti:- </i></p>

    <p><a name='6-695' href='?#6-695'>&nbsp;</a>1. <i>Khuddaka pīti,</i> the thrill of joy that causes &quot;the flesh to

    <p><a name='6-696' href='?#6-696'>&nbsp;</a>2. <i>Khanika pīti,</i> instantaneous joy like a flash of lightning. </p>

	seashore. </p>
    <p><a name='6-698' href='?#6-698'>&nbsp;</a>4. <i>Ubbega pīti,</i> transporting joy which enables one to float in the

    <p><a name='6-699' href='?#6-699'>&nbsp;</a>5. <i>Pharana pīti,</i> suffusing joy, which pervades the whole body like

</blockquote>

<p><a name='6-701' href='?#6-701'>&nbsp;</a>41. <b>Sukha</b> is bliss or happiness. It is a kind of pleasant feeling. It 
is opposed to <i>uddhacca</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> (restlessness and brooding). 
As <i>vitakka</i> is the precursor of <i>vicāra,</i> so is <i>pīti</i> the 
precursor of <i>sukha.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='6-702' href='?#6-702'>&nbsp;</a>The enjoyment of the desired object is its characteristic. It is like a king 
that enjoys a delicious dish. </p>

<p><a name='6-703' href='?#6-703'>&nbsp;</a><i>Pīti</i> creates an interest in the object, while <i>sukha</i>
enables one to enjoy the object. </p>

<p><a name='6-704' href='?#6-704'>&nbsp;</a>Like the sight of an oasis to a weary traveler, is <i>pīti.</i> Like drinking 
water and bathing therein, is <i>sukha</i>. </p>

<p><a name='6-705' href='?#6-705'>&nbsp;</a>This mental <i>sukha</i> which should be differentiated from <i>ahetuka 
kāyika</i> (physical) happiness is identical with <i>somanassa.</i> But it is a 
joy disconnected with material pleasures. This pleasurable feeling is the 
inevitable outcome of renouncing them <i>(nirāmisa sukha). </i>Nibbānic bliss is 
yet far more subtle than Jhānic bliss. There is no feeling in experiencing the 
bliss of Nibbāna. The total release from suffering<i> (dukkhūpasama) </i>is 
itself Nibbānic bliss. It is comparable to the &quot;ease&quot; of an invalid who is 
perfectly cured of a disease. It is a bliss of relief. </p>

<p><a name='6-708' href='?#6-708'>&nbsp;</a><a name="42-Upekkha">42. <b>Upekkhā</b></a> - literally, means seeing <i>
(ikkhati) </i>impartially
<i>(upa = yuttito).</i> It is viewing an object with a balanced mind, 
Atthasālini states: - &quot;This is impartiality <i>(majjhattam)</i> in connection 
with the object, and implies a discriminative knowledge <i>(paricchindanakam 
ñānam)&quot;.</i></p>

<p><a name='6-709' href='?#6-709'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-710' href='?#6-710'>&nbsp;</a>This explanation applies strictly to <i>upekkhā</i> found in <i>sobhana</i>
consciousness accompanied by wisdom. <i>Upekkhā</i> found in the <i>akusalas</i> 
and <i>ahetukas</i>
is just neutral feeling, without the least trace of any discriminative 
knowledge. In the <i>kāmāvacara sobhanas,</i> too, there may arise that neutral 
feeling, as in the case of one hearing the Dhamma without any pleasurable 
interest, and also a subtle form of <i>upekkhā</i> that views the object with 
deliberate impartiality and discriminative knowledge, as in the case of a wise 
person who hears the Dhamma with a critical and impartial mind.</p>

<p><a name='6-711' href='?#6-711'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-712' href='?#6-712'>&nbsp;</a><i>Upekkhā</i> of the Jhāna consciousness, in particular is of ethical and 
psychological importance. It certainly is not the ordinary kind of <i>upekkhā,</i>
generally found in the <i>akusala</i> consciousness which comes naturally to an 
evil-doer. The Jhāna <i>upekkhā</i> has been developed by a strong will-power. 
Realizing that pleasurable feeling is also gross, the Yogi eliminates it as he 
did the other three Jhāna factors, and develops the more subtle and peaceful <i>
upekkhā.</i> On the attainment of the fifth Jhāna breathing ceases. As he has 
transcended both pain and pleasure by will-power, he is immune to pain too. </p>

<p><a name='6-713' href='?#6-713'>&nbsp;</a>This <i>upekkhā</i> is a highly refined form of the ordinary <i>
tatramajjhattatā,</i>
even-mindedness, one of the moral mental states, latent in all types of <i>
sobhana</i>
consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='6-714' href='?#6-714'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-715' href='?#6-715'>&nbsp;</a>In the Pāli phrase - <i>upekkhā satipārisuddhi</i> - purity of mindfulness 
which comes of equanimity - it is the <i>tatra-majjhattatā</i> that is referred 
to. This is latent in the first four Jhānas too. In the fifth Jhāna this <i>
tatra-majjhattatā</i>
is singled out and becomes highly refined. Both neutral feeling <i>upekkhā 
vedanā)</i>
and equanimity that correspond to the one Pāli term <i>upekkhā</i> are found in 
the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p><a name='6-716' href='?#6-716'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-717' href='?#6-717'>&nbsp;</a>Thus there appear to be four kinds of <i>upekkhā</i> viz:- (1) just neutral 
feeling, found in the six <i>akusala cittas,</i> (2) sensitive passive neutral 
feeling <i>(anubhavana upekkhā)</i> found in the eight <i>ahetuka</i> sense-door 
consciousness <i>(dvipañca-viññāna)</i><font SIZE="2"> (excluding <i>
kāyaviññāna)</i></font>, (3) intellectual <i>upekkhā,</i> found mostly in the 
two <i>sobhana kriyā cittas,</i>
accompanied by knowledge, and sometimes in the two <i>sobhana kusala cittas,</i>
accompanied by knowledge, (4) ethical <i>upekkhā,</i> found in all the <i>
sobhana cittas,</i>
especially in the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p><a name='6-719' href='?#6-719'>&nbsp;</a><i>Brahmavihārupekkhā</i> and <i>sankhārupekkhā</i> may be included in both 
intellectual and ethical <i>upekkhā. </i></p>

<p><a name='6-720' href='?#6-720'>&nbsp;</a>The first is equanimity amidst all vicissitudes of life. The second is 
neither attachment nor aversion with respect to all conditioned things. </p>

<p><a name='6-815' href='?#6-815'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-816' href='?#6-816'>&nbsp;</a>The Yogi who has developed the <i>Rūpa</i> Jhānas and who wishes to develop 
the <i>Arūpa</i> Jhānas now concentrates on the Patibhāga Nimitta mentioned in 
the previous section. As he does so, a faint light, like a fire fly, issues from 
the Kasina object. He wills it to expand until it covers the whole space. Now he 
sees nothing but this light pervading everywhere. This developed space is not a 
reality but a mere concept. In Pāli this space is called <i>kasinugghātimākāsa</i> 
(space issuing forth from the Kasina object). On this concept he concentrates 
thinking &quot;<i>ākāso ananto</i>&quot;, &#39;Infinite is space&#39;, until he develops the first <i>
Arūpa</i> <i>Jhāna</i>-<i>ākāsānañcāyatana</i>.
</p>

<p><a name='6-817' href='?#6-817'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-818' href='?#6-818'>&nbsp;</a>As in the case of the <i>Rūpa</i> Jhānas a thought-process, runs as follows:- </p>

<p><a name='6-819' href='?#6-819'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p><a name='6-820' href='?#6-820'>&nbsp;</a>mano-dvārāvajjana, parikamma, upacāra, anuloma, gotrabhū,</p>

    </i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='6-822' href='?#6-822'>&nbsp;</a><i>Parikamma</i> thought-moment may or may not occur. </p>

<p><a name='6-823' href='?#6-823'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-824' href='?#6-824'>&nbsp;</a>The <i>Arūpa</i> Jhāna thought-moment occurs only for a moment, and then the 
consciousness lapses into <i>Bhavanga</i> consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='6-825' href='?#6-825'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-826' href='?#6-826'>&nbsp;</a>Again he concentrates on the first <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> thinking <i>&quot;viññānam 
anantam&quot;, </i>&#39;Infinite is Consciousness&#39; until he develops the second <i>Arūpa 
Jhāna</i> - <i>&quot;viññānañcāyatana&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='6-827' href='?#6-827'>&nbsp;</a></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-828' href='?#6-828'>&nbsp;</a>To develop the third <i>Arūpa Jhāna - &quot;ākiñcaññāyatana&quot;</i> - the Yogi takes 
for his object the first <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness and thinks - <i>
&#39;Natthi kiñci&#39;,</i> &quot;There is nothing whatever&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='6-829' href='?#6-829'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-830' href='?#6-830'>&nbsp;</a>The fourth <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness is developed by taking the third <i>
Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness as the object. The third <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i>
is so subtle and refined that one cannot definitely say whether there is a 
consciousness or not. As he concentrates thus on the third consciousness he 
develops the fourth Jhāna. Although the term <i>&quot;saññā&quot;</i> is used here, <i>
vedanā, </i>(feeling) and <i>sankhārā,
</i>(mental states) are also included therein. </p>

<p><a name='6-831' href='?#6-831'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-832' href='?#6-832'>&nbsp;</a>The five <i>Rūpa Jhānas</i> differ according to the Jhāna factors. These four <i>
Arūpa</i> <i>Jhānas,</i> on the other hand, differ according to the objects of 
concentration. The first and the third have two concepts <i>(paññatti). </i>They 
are the concept of the &#39;infinity of space&#39; and the concept of &#39;nothingness&#39;. The 
second and the fourth Jhāna consciousness have for their objects the first and 
the third Jhāna respectively.</p>

<p><a name='6-833' href='?#6-833'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-834' href='?#6-834'>&nbsp;</a>These four <i>Arūpa Jhānas</i> have their corresponding effects in the <i>
Arūpa</i> spheres. The four <i>Kriyā Jhānas</i> are experienced only by Buddhas 
and Arahats.</p>

<p><a name='6-835' href='?#6-835'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-836' href='?#6-836'>&nbsp;</a>In all these twelve <i>Jhāna Cittas</i> are found the two Jhāna factors - <i>
Upekkhā</i> and <i>ekaggatā</i> - equanimity and one-pointedness that constitute 
the fifth <i>Rūpa Jhāna. </i></p>

<hr>

<p><a name='6-958' href='?#6-958'>&nbsp;</a>45. <b>The Realization of Nibbāna.</b> </p>

<p><a name='6-959' href='?#6-959'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-960' href='?#6-960'>&nbsp;</a>The Yogi who wishes to realize Nibbāna tries to understand things as they 
truly are. With his one-pointed mind he scrutinizes his self and, on due 
examination, discovers that his so-called &quot;Ego-personality&quot; is nothing but a 
mere composition of mind and matter - the former consisting of fleeting mental 
states that arise as a result of the senses coming into contact with the 
sense-stimuli, and the latter of forces and qualities that manifest them-selves 
in multifarious phenomena. </p>

<p><a name='6-961' href='?#6-961'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-962' href='?#6-962'>&nbsp;</a>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of his self, freed from 
the false notion of an identical substance of mind and matter, he attempts to 
investigate the cause of this &quot;Ego-personality.&quot; He realizes that everything 
worldly, himself not excluded, is conditioned by causes past or present, and 
that this existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>
(tanhā),</i> attachment <i>(upādāna),</i>
Kamma, and physical food <i>(āhāra)</i> of the present life. On account of these 
five causes this personality has arisen and as the past activities have 
conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. Meditating 
thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to the past, present, and future <i>
(kankhā-vitarana-visuddhi).</i>
Thereupon he contemplates that all conditioned things are transient <i>(anicca),</i>
subject to suffering <i>(dukkha), </i>and devoid of an immortal soul <i>
(anattā).</i>
Wherever he turns his eyes, he sees nothing but these three characteristics 
standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a mere flowing, continuous 
undivided movement. Neither in a celestial plane nor on earth does he find any 
genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to pain. What is 
transient is therefore subject to suffering and where change and sorrow prevail 
there cannot be a permanent ego. </p>

<p><a name='6-963' href='?#6-963'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-964' href='?#6-964'>&nbsp;</a>As he is thus absorbed in meditation, a day comes when, to his surprise, he 
witnesses an aura emanating from his body <i>(obhāsa). </i>He experiences an 
unprecedented pleasure, happiness, and quietude. He becomes evenminded and 
strenuous. His religious fervour increases, and mindfulness becomes perfect, and 
Insight extraordinarily keen. </p>

<p><a name='6-965' href='?#6-965'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-966' href='?#6-966'>&nbsp;</a>Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress for Sainthood, chiefly owing 
to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking for this mental state. Soon 
the realization comes that these new developments are only obstacles to moral 
progress and he cultivates the &#39;purity of Knowledge&#39; with regard to the &#39;Path&#39; 
and &#39;Non-path&#39; <i>(maggāmagga-ñānadassana visuddhi). </i></p>

<p><a name='6-967' href='?#6-967'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-968' href='?#6-968'>&nbsp;</a>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of conditioned things. Of these 
two characteristics the latter becomes more impressed in his mind, because 
change is more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he turns his attention to 
the contemplation of the dissolution of things <i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He 
perceives that both mind and matter, which constitute his personality, are in a 
state of constant flux, not remaining for two consecutive moments the same. To 
him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving things are fearful <i>(bhaya 
ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a pit of burning embers, a source 
of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava 
ñāna)</i> of the fearful world and feeling disgusted with it <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i>
wishes to escape therefrom <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p><a name='6-969' href='?#6-969'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-970' href='?#6-970'>&nbsp;</a>With this object in view, he meditates again on the three characteristics <i>
(patisankhā ñāna),</i> and thereafter becomes completely indifferent to all 
conditioned things - having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly 
object <i>(sankhārupekkhā ñāna). </i>Reaching this point of mental culture, he 
takes for his object of special endeavour one of the three characteristics that 
appeals to him most, and intently keeps on developing insight in that particular 
direction, until that glorious day when, for the first time, he realizes 
Nibbāna, his ultimate goal.</p>

<p><a name='6-986' href='?#6-986'>&nbsp;</a>When there is no <i>Parikamma</i> thought-moment, in the case of an 
individual with keen Insight, there arise three <i>Phala</i> thought-moments. </p>

<p><a name='6-987' href='?#6-987'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-988' href='?#6-988'>&nbsp;</a>These nine kinds of Insight, viz:- <i>Udaya, Vaya, Bhanga, Bhaya, ādīnava, 
Nibbidā, Muñcitukamyatā, Patisankhā, Sankhārupekkhā </i>and <i>Anuloma ñāna</i> 
are collectively called <i>&quot;Patipadā ñānadassana Visuddhi&quot; </i>- Purity of 
Knowledge and Vision as regards the Practice. </p>

<p><a name='6-990' href='?#6-990'>&nbsp;</a>Insight found in this Supra mundane Path - Consciousness is known as <i>
Ñānadassana Visuddhi </i>- Purity of Knowledge and Vision. </p>

<p><a name='6-991' href='?#6-991'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-992' href='?#6-992'>&nbsp;</a>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time, he is called 
a Sotāpanna - One who has entered the Stream that leads to Nibbāna for the first 
time. He is no more a <a NAME="page68">worldling</a> <i>(puthujjana)</i> but an 
Ariya. He eliminates three Fetters - namely, Self-illusion <i>(sakkāya ditthi),</i> 
Doubts <i>(vicikicchā),</i>
and Adherence to Wrongful Rites and Ceremonies <i>(sīlabbata parāmāsa). </i>As 
he has, not eradicated all the Fetters that bind him to existence, he is reborn 
seven times at the most. In his subsequent birth he may or may not be aware of 
the fact that he is a Sotāpanna. Nevertheless, he possesses the characteristics 
peculiar to such a Saint. </p>

<p><a name='6-993' href='?#6-993'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-994' href='?#6-994'>&nbsp;</a>He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha, and would 
never violate any of the five Precepts. He is moreover absolved from states of 
woe, for he is destined to Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='6-995' href='?#6-995'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-996' href='?#6-996'>&nbsp;</a>Summoning up fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, 
the Aryan pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight becomes a 
Sakadāgāmī. (Once-Returner), by attenuating two other Fetters -namely, 
Sense-desire<i>
(kāmarāga) </i>and Ill-will <i>(patigha). </i></p>

<p><a name='6-997' href='?#6-997'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-998' href='?#6-998'>&nbsp;</a>In this case, too, and in the case of the other two advanced stages of 
Sainthood, a <i>javana</i> thought-process runs as above, but the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is termed <i>&quot;vodāna&quot;</i> (pure) as the individual is purified. </p>

<p><a name='6-999' href='?#6-999'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-1000' href='?#6-1000'>&nbsp;</a>A Sakadāgāmī is reborn on earth only once in case he does not attain 
Arahatship in that life itself. It is interesting to note that the pilgrim who 
has attained the second stage of Sainthood can only weaken these two powerful 
fetters with which he is bound from a beginningless past. Occasionally he may be 
disturbed by thoughts of lust and anger to a slight extent. </p>

<p><a name='6-1001' href='?#6-1001'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-1002' href='?#6-1002'>&nbsp;</a>It is by attaining the third stage of Sainthood, Anāgāmī (State of a 
Never-Returner), that he completely discards the above two Fetters. Thereafter 
he neither returns to this world nor does he seek birth in celestial realms, 
since he has rooted out the desire for sensual pleasures. After death he is 
reborn in the &quot;Pure Abodes&quot; <i>(suddhāvāsa)</i>
environment reserved for Anāgāmīs and Arahats. There he attains Arahatship and 
lives till the end of his life.</p>

<p><a name='6-1003' href='?#6-1003'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-1004' href='?#6-1004'>&nbsp;</a>Now the earnest pilgrim, encouraged by the unprecedented success of his 
endeavours, makes his final advance and destroying the remaining five Fetters - 
namely, Attachment to Form-sphere <i>(rūparāga), </i>Attachment to Formless 
Sphere <i>(arūpa rāga),</i> Conceit <i>(māna),</i> Restlessness <i>(uddhacca),</i> 
and Ignorance <i>(avijjā),
</i>attains Arahatship, the final stage of Sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='6-1005' href='?#6-1005'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-1006' href='?#6-1006'>&nbsp;</a>It will be noted that the Fetters have to be eradicated in four stages. The 
Path <i>(magga) </i>thought-moment occurs only once. The Fruit <i>(phala)</i> 
thought moment immediately follows. In the Supra mundane classes of 
consciousness the effect of the <i>kusala cittas</i> is instantaneous. Hence it 
is called <i>akālika</i> (of immediate fruit); whereas in the case of <i>lokiya 
cittas</i> effects may take place in this life, or in a subsequent life, or at 
any time till one attains Parinibbāna.</p>

<p><a name='6-1007' href='?#6-1007'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='6-1008' href='?#6-1008'>&nbsp;</a>In the Mundane consciousness Kamma is predominant, while in the Supra mundane <i>
paññā</i> or wisdom is predominant. Hence the four <i>kusala lokuttara</i> <i>
cittas</i>
are not treated as Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='6-1010' href='?#6-1010'>&nbsp;</a>These eight <i>cittas</i> are called <i>lokuttara</i>. Here Loka means the <i>
Pañcupādana-kkhandha</i>, the five Aggregates of Attachment. <i>Uttara</i> means 
that which transcends. <i>Lokuttara</i> therefore means that which transcends 
the world of Aggregates of Attachment. This definition strictly applies to the 
Four Paths. The Fruits are called <i>Lokuttara</i> because they have transcended 
the world of Aggregates of Attachment. </p>

<p><a name='6-1015' href='?#6-1015'>&nbsp;</a>One who has attained the First Jhāna emerges from it and meditates on the

<p><a name='9-1' href='?#9-1'>&nbsp;</a><font FACE="Arial"><u><b>CHAPTER II - Mental States (c<i>etasika)</i></b></u></font></p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p><a name='9-2' href='?#9-2'>&nbsp;</a>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p><a name='9-3' href='?#9-3'>&nbsp;</a>In the 89 types of consciousness, enumerated in the first chapter, 52 mental 
states arise in varying degree. </p>

<p><a name='9-4' href='?#9-4'>&nbsp;</a>There are 7 concomitants common to every consciousness. There are 6 others 
that may or may not arise in each and every consciousness. They are termed <i>
Pakinnakā</i>
(Particulars). </p>

<p><a name='9-5' href='?#9-5'>&nbsp;</a>All these 13 are designated <i>aññasamāna,</i> a rather peculiar technical 
term. <i>Añña</i> means &#39;other&#39;, <i>samana</i> means &#39;common&#39;. <i>Sobhanas,</i>
(Good), when compared with <i>asobhanas</i> (Evil,) are called <i>añña</i> - 
&#39;other&#39;, being of the opposite category. So are the <i>asobhanas</i> in 
contradistinction to <i>Sobhanas</i>.
</p>

<p><a name='9-6' href='?#9-6'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-7' href='?#9-7'>&nbsp;</a>These 13 become moral or immoral according to the type of consciousness in 
which they occur. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a name='9-8' href='?#9-8'>&nbsp;</a>14 concomitants are variably found in every type of immoral 
	consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><a name='9-9' href='?#9-9'>&nbsp;</a>19 are common to all types of moral consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><a name='9-10' href='?#9-10'>&nbsp;</a>6 other moral concomitants occur as occasion arises. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-11' href='?#9-11'>&nbsp;</a>Thus these fifty-two (7 + 6 + 14 + 19 + 6 = 52) are found in the respective 
types of consciousness in different proportions. </p>

<p><a name='9-12' href='?#9-12'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-13' href='?#9-13'>&nbsp;</a>In this chapter all the 52 mental states are enumerated and classified. Every 
type of consciousness is microscopically analyzed, and the accompanying mental 
states are given in detail. The type of consciousness in which each mental state 
occurs, is also described. </p>

<p><a name='9-14' href='?#9-14'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-15' href='?#9-15'>&nbsp;</a>To an impatient lay reader this chapter will appear rather dry and 
uninteresting. To a critical and intelligent reader it will, on the contrary, 
serve as an intellectual treat. </p>

<p><a name='9-16' href='?#9-16'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-17' href='?#9-17'>&nbsp;</a>At the outset, for instance, a student of chemistry may find the numerous 
chemical formulas somewhat perplexing. But he finds the subject interesting and 
edifying, when he seriously attempts to analyze and examine the various 
substances with different tests. </p>

<p><a name='9-18' href='?#9-18'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-19' href='?#9-19'>&nbsp;</a>In like manner a student of Abhidhamma who reads this chapter should first 
try to analyze and examine care fully every type of consciousness and see for 
himself the mental states thereof according to his own reasoning. Later, he 
should compare his results with the original text. He will then find this 
chapter most illuminating, and instead of wasting time in memorizing numbers, he 
will intelligently grasp the meaning of the text. </p>

<p><a name='9-20' href='?#9-20'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-21' href='?#9-21'>&nbsp;</a>For example, let us analyze the first immoral type of consciousness, rooted 
in attachment. </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-22' href='?#9-22'>&nbsp;</a><i>Somanassa-sahagata -</i> Accompanied by pleasure,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-23' href='?#9-23'>&nbsp;</a><i>Ditthigata-sampayutta -</i> Connected with misbelief,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-24' href='?#9-24'>&nbsp;</a><i>Asankhārika -</i> Unprompted. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-25' href='?#9-25'>&nbsp;</a>This consciousness, when analyzed, will show that the <i>vedanā</i> or 
feeling is pleasure&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='9-26' href='?#9-26'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-27' href='?#9-27'>&nbsp;</a>The 7 Universals and all the Particulars are found in it.</p>

<p><a name='9-28' href='?#9-28'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-29' href='?#9-29'>&nbsp;</a>The 4 Immoral mental states common to all immorals such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-30' href='?#9-30'>&nbsp;</a> <i>moha</i>
(delusion), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-31' href='?#9-31'>&nbsp;</a> <i>ahirika</i> (shamelessness), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-32' href='?#9-32'>&nbsp;</a> <i>anottappa,</i> (fearlessness),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-33' href='?#9-33'>&nbsp;</a> <i>uddhacca</i> (restlessness) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-34' href='?#9-34'>&nbsp;</a>must arise in it. </p>

<p><a name='9-35' href='?#9-35'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-36' href='?#9-36'>&nbsp;</a>What about the remaining ten? </p>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Lobha</i> - attachment must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Ditthi</i> - misbelief must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Māna</i> - conceit cannot arise. </dt>
    </div>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='9-37' href='?#9-37'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-38' href='?#9-38'>&nbsp;</a>Conceit does not arise in <i>lobha</i> consciousness, together with 
misbelief. <i>Ditthi</i> is connected with wrong view, while <i>māna</i> is 
concerned with egoism. Both of them, say the commentators, are like two lions 
that cannot live together in one cave. </p>

<p><a name='9-39' href='?#9-39'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-40' href='?#9-40'>&nbsp;</a><i>Dosa</i> (hatred), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-41' href='?#9-41'>&nbsp;</a> <i>issā</i> (envy), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-42' href='?#9-42'>&nbsp;</a> <i>macchariya</i> (avarice),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-43' href='?#9-43'>&nbsp;</a> <i>kukkucca</i> (brooding) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-44' href='?#9-44'>&nbsp;</a>cannot arise, because these four are akin to aversion. They are found only in 
hateful consciousness.</p>

<p><a name='9-45' href='?#9-45'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-46' href='?#9-46'>&nbsp;</a><i>Thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> - (sloth and torpor) do not arise because this 
is an unprompted consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='9-47' href='?#9-47'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-48' href='?#9-48'>&nbsp;</a>No <i>sobhanas</i> - (beautiful) occur in an immoral consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='9-49' href='?#9-49'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-50' href='?#9-50'>&nbsp;</a>Total - 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19. </p>

<p><a name='9-51' href='?#9-51'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-52' href='?#9-52'>&nbsp;</a>Thus, on analysis, we see that the first immoral consciousness consists of 19 
mental states. </p>

<p><a name='9-53' href='?#9-53'>&nbsp;</a>The other types of consciousness should be similarly analyzed. </p>

material qualities such as <i>viññatti rūpa*</i> (Modes of Intimation) - that 
arise and perish simultaneously with the consciousness. To exclude them the 
third property of having a common object has been attributed. That which 
possesses these three characteristics must necessarily be endowed with the 
fourth - a common basis. </p>

<p><a name='9-141' href='?#9-141'>&nbsp;</a>2. <b>Phassa</b>- Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>phas,</i>
to contact.</p>

<p><a name='9-142' href='?#9-142'>&nbsp;</a>For any sense-impression to occur, three things are essential - namely, 
consciousness, respective sense and the object. For instance, one sees an object 
with the consciousness through the eye as its instrument. </p>

<p><a name='9-143' href='?#9-143'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-144' href='?#9-144'>&nbsp;</a>When an object presents itself to the consciousness through one of the six 
senses there arises the mental state-contact. &quot;It should not be understood that 
mere collision is contact<i> (Na sangatimatto eva Phasso). </i></p>

<p><a name='9-145' href='?#9-145'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-146' href='?#9-146'>&nbsp;</a>Like a pillar which acts as a strong support to the rest of the structure, 
even so is contact to the coexistent mental concomitants. </p>

<p><a name='9-147' href='?#9-147'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-148' href='?#9-148'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Contact means &#39;it touches&#39; <i>(phusatī&#39;ti).</i> It has touching <i>(phusana)</i>
as its salient characteristic <i>(lakkhana), </i>impact <i>(sanghattana)</i> as 
its function <i>(rasa), </i>coinciding (of the physical basis, object and 
consciousness) as its manifestation <i>(sannipāta paccupatthāna),</i> and the 
object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause <i>
(padatthāna).&quot;</i> </p>

<p><a name='9-149' href='?#9-149'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-150' href='?#9-150'>&nbsp;</a>Contact is mentioned first because it precedes all other mental states. 
&quot;Touching by contact, consciousness experiences by feeling, perceives by 
perception, wills by volition - <i>(Phassena phusitvā, vedanāya vediyati, 
saññāya sañjānāti, cetanāya ceteti)&quot;.</i> According to <i>Paticca-Samuppāda,</i> 
too, Contact conditions Feeling. But strictly speaking, there is no reason for 
the sequence because all these mental states are coexistent. The Atthasālini 
states - &quot;For of states, arisen in one conscious moment, it is not valid to say 
that &#39;this&#39; arises first, &#39;that&#39; afterwards. The reason is not because contact 
is a strong support. Contact is just mentioned first in the order of teaching, 
but it was also permissible to bring it in thus: - There are feeling and 
contact, perception and contact, volition and contact; there are consciousness 
and contact, feeling, perception, volition, initial application of mind. In the 
order of teaching, however, contact is mentioned first. Nor is the sequence of 
words among the remaining states of any special significance.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-151' href='?#9-151'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-152' href='?#9-152'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Contact is given priority of place, as standing for the inception of the 
thought, and as the sine qua non of all the allied states, conditioning them 
much as the roof-tree of a storeyed house supports all the other combinations of 
material.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-157' href='?#9-157'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Vedanā</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vid,</i>
to experience. </p>

<p><a name='9-158' href='?#9-158'>&nbsp;</a>Feeling is a more appropriate rendering for <i>vedanā</i> than sensation. 
Like contact, feeling is an essential property of every consciousness. It may be 
pleasurable painful, or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. But 
physical feeling is not of ethical importance. </p>

<p><a name='9-159' href='?#9-159'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-160' href='?#9-160'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentators feeling is like a master who enjoys a dish 
prepared by a cook. The latter is compared to the remaining mental states that 
constitute a thought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that experiences 
an object when it comes in contact with the senses. </p>

<p><a name='9-161' href='?#9-161'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-162' href='?#9-162'>&nbsp;</a>It is this feeling that experiences the desirable or undesirable fruits of an 
action done in this or in a previous birth. Besides this mental state there is 
no soul or any other agent to experience the result of the action. </p>

<p><a name='9-163' href='?#9-163'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-164' href='?#9-164'>&nbsp;</a>It should be understood here that Nibbānic bliss is not connected with 
feeling. Nibbānic bliss is certainly the highest happiness <i>(sukha),</i> but 
it is the happiness of relief from suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a 
pleasurable object. </p>

<p><a name='9-167' href='?#9-167'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Saññā</b> - <i>Sam</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i>
to know, (Compare Latin cognoscere, to know.)</p>

<p><a name='9-168' href='?#9-168'>&nbsp;</a>The meaning of this term widely varies according to the context. To avoid 
unnecessary confusion, it is best to understand the specific meaning used in the 
particular connection as a universal mental state. </p>

<p><a name='9-169' href='?#9-169'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-170' href='?#9-170'>&nbsp;</a>The chief characteristic of <i>saññā</i> is the cognition of an object by way 
of a mark as blue etc. It is <i>saññā</i> that enables one to recognize an 
object that has once been perceived by the mind through the senses. &quot;Its 
procedure is likened to the carpenter&#39;s recognition of certain kinds of wood by 
the mark he had made on each; to the treasurer&#39;s specifying certain articles of 
jewelry by the ticket on each; to the wild animal&#39;s discernment in the scarecrow 
of the work of man.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-171' href='?#9-171'>&nbsp;</a><i>Saññā,</i> therefore, means simple sense perception.</p>

<p><a name='9-172' href='?#9-172'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-173' href='?#9-173'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Perception,&quot; according to a modern Dictionary of Philosophy, &quot;is the 
apprehension of ordinary sense-objects, such as trees, houses, chairs, etc., on 
the occasion of sensory stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-174' href='?#9-174'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-175' href='?#9-175'>&nbsp;</a>Perception is not used here in the sense employed by early modern 
philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. </p>

<p><a name='9-176' href='?#9-176'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-177' href='?#9-177'>&nbsp;</a>As one of the five <i>khandhas</i> (Aggregates) <i>saññā</i> is used in the 
sense of perception. </p>

<p><a name='9-178' href='?#9-178'>&nbsp;</a>Could it be that memory is due to this <i>saññā? </i></p>

<p><a name='9-179' href='?#9-179'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-180' href='?#9-180'>&nbsp;</a><i>Saññā, viññāna</i> and <i>paññā</i> should be differentiated from one 
another. <i>Saññā</i> is like the mere perception of a rupee coin by a child. By 
its whiteness, roundness and size it merely recognizes the coin as a rupee, 
utterly ignorant of its monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its value 
and its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition. <i>Viññāna</i> is 
comparable to the ordinary man&#39;s knowledge of the rupee. <i>Paññā</i> is like 
the analytical knowledge of a chemist who knows all its chemical properties in 
every detail. </p>

<p><a name='9-181' href='?#9-181'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-183' href='?#9-183'>&nbsp;</a>5. <b>Cetanā</b> - </p>

<p><a name='9-184' href='?#9-184'>&nbsp;</a>Both <i>cetanā</i> and <i>citta</i> are derived from the same root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>cit,</i> to think. </p>

<p><a name='9-185' href='?#9-185'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of <i>citta</i> - mind or consciousness - the root assumes the 
meaning of discernment <i>(vijānana),</i> while in <i>cetanā</i> it is used in 
the sense of co-ordination <i>(abhisandhāna) </i>and accumulation <i>(āyūhana).</i></p>

<p><a name='9-186' href='?#9-186'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-187' href='?#9-187'>&nbsp;</a>According to the Atthasālini and Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>cetanā</i> is that which 
co-ordinates the mental states associated with itself on the object of 
consciousness. <i>(Attanā sampayutta-dhamme ārammane abhisandahati). </i>Like a 
chief disciple, or like a carpenter who fulfills his duties and regulates the 
work of others as well, so does <i>cetanā</i> fulfill its own function and 
regulate the function of other concomitants associated with itself.</p>

<p><a name='9-188' href='?#9-188'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-189' href='?#9-189'>&nbsp;</a>A further explanation has been offered. <i>Cetanā</i> is that which arrives 
at action in conditioning the conditioned. <i>(Sankhatābhisankharane va byāpāram 
āpajjatī&#39;ti cetanā).</i> <i>Cetanā</i> is that which plays a predominant part in 
all actions, moral and immoral.</p>

<p><a name='9-190' href='?#9-190'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-191' href='?#9-191'>&nbsp;</a>Shwe Zan Aung says that according to Ledi Sayadaw, the Burmese Abhidhamma 
scholar, &quot;Cetanā acts on its concomitants, acts in getting the object, and acts 
on accomplishing the task, i.e., determines action.&quot; (Compendium, p. 236).</p>

<p><a name='9-192' href='?#9-192'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-193' href='?#9-193'>&nbsp;</a>The most significant mental state in the Mundane Consciousness <i>(lokiya)</i>
is this <i>cetanā,</i> while in the Supra mundane it is <i>paññā,</i> wisdom or 
insight. Mundane thoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supra mundane thoughts, on 
the contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma. Hence <i>cetanā</i> in the supra mundane 
consciousness does not constitute Kamma. <i>Cetanā</i> in every moral and 
immoral type of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, is regarded as Kamma. 
Although <i>Cetanā</i> is found in <i>Vipāka</i> types of consciousness too, it 
is of no moral significance as it lacks accumulative power. </p>

<p><a name='9-194' href='?#9-194'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-195' href='?#9-195'>&nbsp;</a>It is this <i>cetanā</i> that is alluded to as <i>sankhāra</i> and (Kamma) <i>
bhava</i> in the <i>Paticca Samuppāda.</i> In the <i>pañcakkhandha,</i> by <i>
sankhārakkhandha</i>
are meant the fifty mental states, excluding <i>vedanā</i> and <i>saññā,</i> 
with <i>cetanā</i>
as the foremost. </p>

<p><a name='9-196' href='?#9-196'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-197' href='?#9-197'>&nbsp;</a>From a psychological standpoint <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of 
the mental states associated with it. From an ethical standpoint, it determines 
its inevitable consequences. Hence where there is no <i>cetanā,</i> there is no 
Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='9-201' href='?#9-201'>&nbsp;</a><i>Eka + agga + tā</i> = one-pointedness, or concentration on one object, or 
focusing the mind on one object. It is like a steady lamp-flame in a windless 
place. It is like a firmly fixed pillar that cannot be shaken by the wind. It is 
like water that binds together several substances to form one concrete compound.

<p><a name='9-328' href='?#9-328'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;<i>Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa,</i> as analyzed by Buddhaghosa present points of 
considerable ethical interest. Taken together they give us the emotional and 
conative aspect of the modern notion of conscience, just as <i>sati</i> 
represents its intellectual side. The former term &#39;is equivalent to shame <i>
(lajjā),&#39; </i>the latter to &#39;anguish <i>(ubbego) </i>over evildoing.&#39; <i>Hiri</i> 
has its source within; <i>ottappa</i>
spring from without. <i>Hiri</i> is autonomous <i>(attādhipati); ottappa,</i>
heteronomous, influenced by society <i>(lokādhipati). </i>The former is 
established on shame; the latter on dread. The former is marked by consistency; 
the latter by discernment of the danger and fearsomeness of error. The 
subjective source of <i>hiri</i> is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to 
one&#39;s birth, age, worth, and education. Thus, one having <i>hiri</i>
will think &#39;Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poor wretches, the blind and 
ignorant, would do such an act,&#39; and refrains. The external source of <i>ottappa</i> 
is, the idea that &#39;the body of the faithful will blame you,&#39; and hence one 
refrains. If a man has <i>hiri,</i>
he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To one who is sensitive by way 
of <i>ottappa,</i>
the masters of the faith are the best guides.&quot;</p>

<p><a name='9-330' href='?#9-330'>&nbsp;</a>In a supplementary paragraph the &#39;marks&#39; (consistency etc.) are thus 
explained: &#39;In <i>hiri</i> one reflects on the worth of one&#39;s birth, one&#39;s 
teacher, one&#39;s estate, and one&#39;s fellow students. In <i>ottappa</i> one feels 
dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribution in 
another life.&quot; </p>

Mindfulness is a better equivalent for <i>sati.</i> It has to be developed. In

When it is highly developed one acquires the power of remembering past births. 
It is this <i>sati</i>

object of thought. </p>

<p><a name='9-442' href='?#9-442'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Buddhaghosa&#39;s comment on <i>sati,</i> in which he closely follows and 
enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38, shows that the traditional conception of 
that aspect of consciousness had much in common with the Western modern theory 
of conscience or moral sense. <i>Sati</i> appears under the metaphor of an 
inward mentor, discriminating between good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy 
went so far as to render it by &#39;conscience&#39;, but this slurs over the interesting 
divergence&#39;s between Eastern and Western thought. The former is quite unmystical 
of the subject of <i>sati.</i> It takes the psychological process or 
representative functioning (without bringing out the distinction between bare 
memory and judgment), and presents the same under an ethical aspect&quot;. </p>

is not mentioned amongst the nineteen Beautiful <i>cetasikas</i> because it is 
implied by <i>paññā</i>
- wisdom.</p>

<p><a name='9-460' href='?#9-460'>&nbsp;</a>Atthasālini gives a vivid description of these three virtues as follows:</p>

<p><a name='9-461' href='?#9-461'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Of these three, <i>alobha</i> has the characteristic of non-adhesion of the 
mind to an object, or of not sticking like a drop of water on a lotus leaf. Its 
function is non-appropriation like an emancipated Bhikkhu (Arahat). Its 
manifestation is detachment like a man fallen in filth. </p>

<p><a name='9-462' href='?#9-462'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Adosa</i> has the characteristic of non-churlishness or non-resentment 
like an agreeable friend. Its function is the suppression of annoyance or 
feverishness like sandal wood. Its manifestation is loveliness like the full 
moon. The characteristic, function, etc., of <i>amoha</i> have been explained in 
connection with the term <i>paññindriya</i> (Faculty of Wisdom). Of these three, 
again, <i>alobha</i> is opposed to the taint of selfishness, <i>adosa</i> to 
that of impurity <i>(dussīlya), amoha</i> to the non-development of moral 
conditions. </p>

<p><a name='9-463' href='?#9-463'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Alobha </i>is the cause of generosity, <i>adosa</i> of morality, <i>amoha</i> 
of meditation. </p>

<p><a name='9-464' href='?#9-464'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-465' href='?#9-465'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> what is in excess is not taken, for the greedy take 
what is in excess. Through <i>adosa</i> what is not less is taken, for the 
hateful take what is less. Through <i>amoha</i> what is unperverted is taken, 
for the deluded take what is perverted. Through <i>alobha,</i> one regards a 
manifest fault as such and admits it, but the greedy conceal it. Through <i>
adosa</i> one regards a manifest virtue as such and admits it, but the hateful 
efface it. Through <i>amoha,</i> one regards what really is as such and admits 
it, but the deluded regard what is false as true, and what is true as false. </p>

<p><a name='9-466' href='?#9-466'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-467' href='?#9-467'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is no sorrow arising from separation of the 
beloved, for affection is the intrinsic nature of the greedy as well as the 
inability to bear the separation from the beloved. Through <i>adosa</i> there 
arises no sorrow from association with the unbeloved since disagreeableness is 
the intrinsic nature of the hateful as well as the inability to bear the 
association with the unbeloved. Through <i>amoha</i> there arises no sorrow from 
not getting what one desires, for it is the intrinsic nature of the deluded to 
think - &#39;From where could it be got?&#39; etc. </p>

<p><a name='9-469' href='?#9-469'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there arises no sorrow from rebirth, since the former 
is opposed to craving and the latter is the root of craving. Through <i>adosa</i>
there arises no sorrow from decay, since the intensely hateful become quickly 
aged. Through <i>amoha</i> there is not sorrow from death, for a bewildered 
death is painful. There is no such death for the undeluded. </p>

devoid of the feeling of ill-will even amongst the hostile. Through <i>amoha</i>

one with a loving-disposition has abandoned that grasping, the cause of 
vexation, and sees things as sorrowful. Through <i>amoha</i> there is insight

virtues is well worth reading. </p>

<p><a name='9-568' href='?#9-568'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;On these four great exercises, see Rhys Davids, S. B. E. xi 201, n.; and on 
their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa again refers to the reader to 
his Visuddhi Magga for a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix, and cf. Hardy, 
&#39;Eastern Monachism&#39;, p . 243 et seq. )... The object of thought <i>(ārammana)</i> 
in this connection will be &#39;limited&#39; if the student dwells in love etc., on but 
a restricted number of beings; &#39;infinite&#39; if his heart embraces vast numbers.</p>

<p><a name='9-569' href='?#9-569'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;The commentator has not a little to say in the present work, however, on the 
nature and mutual relations of the &#39;Abodes&#39; (pp. 193-195). First, the 
characteristics of each are fully set forth, together with their false 
manifestation <i>(vipatti).
</i>Clinging <i>(sinehasambhavo)</i> is the <i>vipatti</i> of love, the 
essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent conduct etc. Tears and 
the like are less truly characteristic of pity <i>(karunā)</i> than is the 
bearing and relieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are less genuine 
expressions of sympathy <i>(muditā) </i>than is appreciation of what others have 
achieved. And there is a condition of disinterestedness <i>(upekkhā)</i> which 
is prompted by ignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of mankind 
which can avail to calm the passions.</p>

<p><a name='9-570' href='?#9-570'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-571' href='?#9-571'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;He next designates the four antisocial attitudes which are to be extirpated 
by these ethical disciplines taken in order - ill-will <i>(vyāpāda),</i>
cruelty <i>(vihesā),</i> aversion <i>(arati), </i>and passion <i>(rāga) </i>- 
and shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms 
its near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical opposite, 
the latter resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. 
Love and vengeful conduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let love 
be developed fearlessly. But where love and its object have too much in common, 
love is threatened by lust. On this side let love be guarded well. Again the 
near enemy to pity, more insidious than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for 
what one has not got or has lost - a low, profane melancholy. And the 
corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, or in consequence of 
obliviousness as to what one has lost, lies in wait to stifle appreciation of 
the good fortune of others. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of 
the worldling who has not triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and 
effect, being unable to transcend external things.

four Abodes, and the importance of observing method in their cultivation, and 
finally with their other technical appellation of <i>appamaññā</i> or 
infinitudes. In this connection he repeats the touching illustration given in 
Hardy (op. Cit., 249) of the mother, and the four children. Her desire for the 
growth of the infant is as <i>mettā;</i>
for the recovery of the sick child as <i>karunā;</i> for the maintenance of the

<p><a name='9-575' href='?#9-575'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;It may be remarked, by the way, that when Hardy with a foreigner&#39;s want of <i>
muditā</i> calumniates the Buddhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about 
the virtues of solidarity without practicing them, he quite forgets that these 
exercises are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the 
intellectual need of others to which the recluse&#39;s life was largely devoted, and 
the importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of charity, 
does not even now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did not believe in 
giving the rein to good impulses unregulated by intellectual control&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='9-581' href='?#9-581'>&nbsp;</a><i>Pa</i> = rightly; <i>ñā,</i> to know, <i>paññā,</i> literally, means right

understanding, i.e., penetrative knowledge <i>(Yathāsabhāva-pativedho vā

<p><a name='9-583' href='?#9-583'>&nbsp;</a>As <i>paññā</i> dominates in understanding the real nature and as it 
overcomes ignorance, it is called a controlling faculty <i>(indriya). </i></p>

<p><a name='9-584' href='?#9-584'>&nbsp;</a>In Abhidhamma <i>ñāna, paññā,</i> and <i>amoha</i> are used as 
interchangeable terms. In types of consciousness connected with knowledge <i>
(ñāna-sampayutta)</i>
the reference is to this <i>paññā.</i> By <i>amoha,</i> one of the three moral 
roots, is also meant this <i>paññā</i>. As one of the four means of 
accomplishing one&#39;s ends <i>(iddhi-pāda)</i>
it assumes the name of <i>vīmamsā</i> (lit., examination). When purified by <i>
samādhi,</i>
<i>paññā</i> assumes the honorable role of <i>abhiññā</i> (higher knowledge). 
Highly developed <i>paññā</i> is elevated to the state of a <i>
bojjhanga-dhamma-vicaya</i>
(Investigation of the Truth) and <i>magganga-sammā ditthi,</i> Right View. The 
culmination of <i>paññā</i> is the Omniscience of a Buddha. </p>

<p><a name='9-585' href='?#9-585'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-586' href='?#9-586'>&nbsp;</a><i>Paññā,</i> in the strictest sense of the term, is seeing things as they 
truly are, i.e., in the light of <i>anicca</i> (impermanence), <i>dukkha</i>
(sorrow), and <i>anattā</i> (soullessness). </p>

<p><a name='9-587' href='?#9-587'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-588' href='?#9-588'>&nbsp;</a>Reason, intellect, insight, knowledge, wisdom, intelligence - all convey some 
aspects of <i>paññā,</i> but none of them exactly corresponds to the Pāli term. 
Both knowledge and wisdom are employed here according to the context. </p>

<p><a name='9-589' href='?#9-589'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-590' href='?#9-590'>&nbsp;</a>Mrs. Rhys David&#39;s comment on this important term is interesting. She writes:- </p>

<p><a name='9-591' href='?#9-591'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;To fit the term <i>paññā</i> with its approximate European equivalent is one 
of the cruxes of Buddhist philosophy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, 
insight, science, understanding and knowledge. All of these have been, and are, 
used in the literature of philosophy with varying shades of connotation, 
according as the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and 
precise or transcendental and - <i>passez-moi le mot</i> - having precise 
vagueness.</p>

<p><a name='9-592' href='?#9-592'>&nbsp;</a>And each of them might, with one implication or another, represent <i>paññā</i>. 
The main difficulty in choice lay in determining whether, to the Buddhist, <i>
paññā </i>stood for mental function, or for the aggregate product of certain 
mental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to <i>paññā </i>in the 
Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation becomes possible. Here it 
must suffice to quote two. M i. 292, he who has <i>paññā (paññavā) </i>is 
declared in virtue thereof to understand <i>(pajānāti)</i>
the nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 
124 Gotama asks: what is this <i>paññā</i>? and himself sets out its content as 
consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the Jhānas, insight into 
the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one&#39;s self, the power of <i>
iddhi,</i> the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, into one&#39;s own past lives, 
the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa 
also (Visuddhi Magga Ch. XIV,) distinguishes <i>paññā</i>
from <i>saññā</i> and <i>viññāna.</i> He describes it as adequate to discern not 
only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain 
and non-substantiality) respectively, but also the path. For him, then, it might 
be called intellect &#39;at a higher power&#39;. And in Gotama&#39;s reply, all those terms 
are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
the term did not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree of 
complexity, but that it also implied mental process as cultivated in accordance 
with a certain system of concepts objectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. 
Hence I think it best to reject such terms as reason, intellect, and 
understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, or knowledge, or philosophy. 
Only they must be understood in this connection as implying the body of learning 
as assimilated and applied by the intellect of a given individual&quot;. </p>

such it also is present only in types of consciousness rooted in attachment. 
Nevertheless, both ditthi and māna do not arise simultaneously in one particular 
consciousness. Where there is ditthi there is no māna. Commentaries compare them 
to two fearless lions that cannot live in one den. Māna may arise in those four 
types of consciousness dissociated with ditthi. But it does not follow that māna 
is ever present in them.]</p>

<p><a name='9-695' href='?#9-695'>&nbsp;</a>(*4) These four cannot arise in a consciousness rooted in attachment because 
there is some form of aversion in them instead of any of clinging. Even

prompted consciousness.</p>

<p><a name='9-758' href='?#9-758'>&nbsp;</a>Of the 52 types of mental states eleven are called <i>aniyatayogi</i> - 
unfixed adjuncts. They arise in different kinds of consciousness separately 
because their particular objects differ. They may or may not arise in those 
types of consciousness to which they are allied. For instance, <i>issā, 
macchariya,</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> must arise in a consciousness connected with 
aversion. One of the three must arise at one particular moment. All the three do 
not occur simultaneously. Besides they are not bound to be present in such a 
consciousness. So are the three Abstinences, two Illimitables, Conceit, Sloth 
and Torpor. </p>

<p><a name='9-759' href='?#9-759'>&nbsp;</a>The remaining 41 types are called <i>niyatayogi</i> - fixed adjuncts. They

<p><a name='9-763' href='?#9-763'>&nbsp;</a>These three are collectively found only in the Supra mundane consciousness, 
as they constitute three of eight factors of the Noble Path. They cannot arise 
in the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara,</i> nor in the <i>kāmāvacara vipāka</i> 
and <i>kriyā cittas.</i> They deal with three forms of refraining from 
committing evil through word, deed, and livelihood. As such they arise 
separately only in the eight types of moral consciousness according to the 
abstinence from the particular evil. </p>

<p><a name='9-764' href='?#9-764'>&nbsp;</a>These Abstinences appear in full force only in the <i>lokuttara-cittas,</i>
because the corresponding evils are completely eradicated by them. In the <i>

there is only a temporary inhibition of evil.</p>

<p><a name='9-765' href='?#9-765'>&nbsp;</a>As <i>kāmāvacara-vipāka-cittas</i> are merely effects they cannot arise in 
them. Since <i>kriyā-cittas</i> are experienced only by Arahats, they do not

not occur because the need for moral purification, the function of these 
abstinences, does not arise there. </p>

<p><a name='9-772' href='?#9-772'>&nbsp;</a>They do not occur in the fifth Jhāna as it is accompanied by <i>upekkhā</i>

<h4>Notes - </h4>

<p><a name='2-42' href='?#2-42'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-43' href='?#2-43'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Vedanā</b> is a significant mental state which is common to all types 
of consciousness. Feeling is its characteristic <i>(vedayita-lakkhana), </i>and 
is born of contact. Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering for <i>
vedanā. </i></p>

<p><a name='2-44' href='?#2-44'>&nbsp;</a>Feeling is defined as: &quot;a conscious, subjective impression which does not 
involve cognition or representation of an object.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p><a name='2-45' href='?#2-45'>&nbsp;</a>Sensation is explained as: &quot;the content of sensuous intuition, or the way in 
which a conscious subject is modified by the presence of an object.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='2-46' href='?#2-46'>&nbsp;</a><i>Vedanā</i> modifies the stream of consciousness and serves both as a 
life-promoting and life-destroying force. Pleasure, for example, promotes life; 
pain impairs it. As such feeling plays a very important part in the life of man. </p>

<p><a name='2-47' href='?#2-47'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-48' href='?#2-48'>&nbsp;</a>Experiencing the taste of an object is the function of <i>vedanā (anubhavana 
rasa).</i> Particular likes and dislikes depend on the desirability and the 
undesirability of the external object. Generally they are mechanistic. </p>

<p><a name='2-49' href='?#2-49'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-50' href='?#2-50'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes the freewill of a person determines the mode of feeling independent 
of the nature of the object. The sight of an enemy, for example, would normally 
be a source of displeasure, but a right-understanding person would, on the 
contrary, extend his loving-kindness towards him and experience some kind of 
pleasure. Socrates, for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and faced a 
happy death. Once a certain Brahman poured a torrent of abuse on the Buddha, but 
He kept smiling and returned love unto him. The ascetic Khantivādi, who was 
brutally tortured by a drunkard king, wished him long life instead of cursing 
him. </p>

<p><a name='2-51' href='?#2-51'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-52' href='?#2-52'>&nbsp;</a>A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the other hand, may even, at the sight of a 
Buddha, harbour a thought of hatred. His feeling will be one of displeasure. 
Likewise a similar feeling may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhist at the 
sight of a religious teacher of an alien faith. What is meat and drink to one, 
may be poison to another. </p>

<p><a name='2-53' href='?#2-53'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-54' href='?#2-54'>&nbsp;</a>Material pleasures, for instance, would be highly prized by an average 
person. An understanding recluse would find happiness in renouncing them and 
leading a life of voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a solitary life, a 
sensualist may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven to one may be hell to another; 
what is hell to one may be heaven to another. We ourselves create them, and they 
are more or less mind-made. </p>

<p><a name='2-55' href='?#2-55'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-56' href='?#2-56'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;There are, o Bhikkhus, two kinds of feeling-pain and happiness&quot;, says the 
Buddha. Well, then, how can there be a third which is neither pain nor 
happiness? The commentary states that blameless neutral feeling is included in 
happiness and the blameworthy in pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-57' href='?#2-57'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-58' href='?#2-58'>&nbsp;</a>Again, the Buddha has stated that whatever is felt in this world, all that is 
pain. It is because of the changeable nature of all conditioned things. </p>

<p><a name='2-59' href='?#2-59'>&nbsp;</a>From another standpoint considering all forms of feeling as purely mental, 
there are only three kinds - namely, happiness <i>(sukha),</i> pain <i>(dukkha), </i>
and neutral <i>(adukkhamasukha). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-60' href='?#2-60'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-61' href='?#2-61'>&nbsp;</a>Atthasālini explains them, as follows:-</p>

<p><a name='2-62' href='?#2-62'>&nbsp;</a>The term <i>sukha</i> means &#39;pleasurable feeling&#39; <i>(sukha-vedanā), </i>
&#39;root of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-mūla),</i> &#39;pleasurable object&#39; <i>(sukhārammana),</i> 
&#39;cause of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-hetu),</i> &#39;conditioning state of pleasure, <i>
(sukha-paccayatthāna),</i>
free from troubles&#39; <i>(abyāpajjhā),</i> &#39;Nibbāna&#39;, etc.</p>

<p><a name='2-63' href='?#2-63'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-64' href='?#2-64'>&nbsp;</a>In the expression: &quot;By eliminating <i>sukha</i>&quot; - <i>sukha</i>
means pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-65' href='?#2-65'>&nbsp;</a>In the expression: &quot;<i>Sukha</i> is non-attachment in this world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means root of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-66' href='?#2-66'>&nbsp;</a>In the expression: &quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>sukha,</i> falls and descends 
on sukha&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means object of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-67' href='?#2-67'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Merit, o Bhikkhus, is a synonym for <i>sukha</i>.&quot; Here <i>sukha</i>
means cause of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-68' href='?#2-68'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Not easy is it, o Bhikkhus, to attain to heavenly <i>sukha</i> by 
description&quot;. &quot;They know not <i>sukha</i> who do not see <i>nandana</i>&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means conditioning state of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-69' href='?#2-69'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;These states constitute a <i>sukha</i> life in this very world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means freedom from troubles.</p>

<p><a name='2-70' href='?#2-70'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Nibbāna is supreme <i>sukha&#39;&#39;.</i> Here <i>sukha</i> means Nibbāna. </p>

<p><a name='2-71' href='?#2-71'>&nbsp;</a>From these quotations the reader can understand in what different senses the 
term <i>sukha</i> is used in the texts. In this particular connection the term <i>
sukha</i>
is used in the sense of pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-72' href='?#2-72'>&nbsp;</a>Nibbāna is stated to be supreme bliss <i>(sukha). </i>This does not mean that 
there is a pleasurable feeling in Nibbāna although the term <i>sukha</i> is 
used. Nibbāna is a bliss of relief. The release from suffering is itself 
Nibbānic bliss.
</p>

<p><a name='2-73' href='?#2-73'>&nbsp;</a>The term <i>dukkha</i> means &#39;painful feeling&#39;, &#39;basis of pain&#39;, object of 
pain&#39;, cause of pain&#39;, &#39;conditioning state of pain&#39;, etc. </p>

<p><a name='2-74' href='?#2-74'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;&#39;By eliminating <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means painful feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-75' href='?#2-75'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Birth too is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means basis of pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-76' href='?#2-76'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>dukkha</i>, falls and descends on pain&quot; - here <i>
dukkha</i> means object of <i>dukkha. </i></p>

<p><a name='2-77' href='?#2-77'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Accumulation of evil is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i>
means cause of pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-78' href='?#2-78'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;It is not easy, o Bhikkhus, to realize the pain of woeful states by 
description&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means &quot;conditioning states of pain.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='2-79' href='?#2-79'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-80' href='?#2-80'>&nbsp;</a>In this particular connection the term <i>dukkha</i> is used in the sense of 
painful feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-81' href='?#2-81'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-82' href='?#2-82'>&nbsp;</a>In the Dhammacakka Sutta the Buddha enumerates eight divisions of <i>dukkha
</i>-namely: </p>

<p><a name='2-83' href='?#2-83'>&nbsp;</a>1. Birth is suffering, 2. decay is suffering, 3. disease is suffering, 4. 
death is suffering, 5. association with the unpleasant is suffering, 6. 
separation from the beloved is suffering, 7. when one does not obtain what one 
desires there is suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering. </p>

<p><a name='2-84' href='?#2-84'>&nbsp;</a>All these are the causes of <i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='2-85' href='?#2-85'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-86' href='?#2-86'>&nbsp;</a>When the Buddha addresses Devas and men He speaks of eight kinds of <i>
dukkha.</i>
When He addresses only men He speaks of twelve. Instead of <i>vyādhi</i> 
(disease) He says <i>soka</i> (grief), <i>parideva</i> (lamentation), <i>dukkha</i> 
(pain), <i>domanassa</i>
(displeasure) <i>upāyāsa</i> (despair) are suffering. All these five are 
included in <i>vyādhi</i>
which embraces both physical and mental disharmony. </p>

<p><a name='2-87' href='?#2-87'>&nbsp;</a><i>Soka, domanassa,</i> and <i>upāyāsa</i> are mental, while <i>dukkha</i>
and <i>parideva</i> are physical. </p>

<p><a name='2-88' href='?#2-88'>&nbsp;</a>Practically there is no marked difference between the two formulas. </p>

<p><a name='2-89' href='?#2-89'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-90' href='?#2-90'>&nbsp;</a><b>Adukkha-m-asukha</b> is that which is neither pain nor happiness. It is a 
neutral feeling. This corresponds to both stolid indifference and Stoic 
indifference. The Pāli term <i>upekkhā,</i> which has a wider connotation, is 
more frequently used to denote this kind of neutral feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-91' href='?#2-91'>&nbsp;</a>In an immoral type of consciousness <i>upekkhā</i> assumes the role of stolid 
indifference because it is prompted by ignorance. In an <i>ahetuka</i> resultant 
consciousness, such as a sense-impression, <i>upekkhā</i> means simple neutral 
feeling which has no ethical value. <i>Adukkha-m-asukha</i> strictly applies in 
this connection. <i>Upekkhā</i>
latent in a <i>kāmāvacara sobhana citta</i> (Beautiful type of consciousness 
pertaining to the Sense-sphere) may be any of the following states - simple 
indifference (not stolid because there is no ignorance), simple neutral feeling, 
disinterestedness, unbiased feeling, Stoic indifference, and perfect equanimity. </p>

<p><a name='2-92' href='?#2-92'>&nbsp;</a><i>Upekkhā</i> in the <i>jhāna</i> consciousness is perfect equanimity born 
of concentration. It is both ethical and intellectual. </p>

<p><a name='2-94' href='?#2-94'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-95' href='?#2-95'>&nbsp;</a>According to a still wider classification <i>vedanā</i> is fivefold namely. </p>

<p><a name='2-102' href='?#2-102'>&nbsp;</a>All feelings, from an ultimate standpoint, are mental because <i>vedanā</i>
is a <i>cetasikā.</i> But a differentiation has been made with regard to <i>
sukha</i> and
<i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='2-103' href='?#2-103'>&nbsp;</a>Of all the 89 types of consciousness only two are associated with either <i>
sukha</i> or <i>dukkha.</i> One is the body-consciousness associated with 
happiness, and the other is body-consciousness associated with pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-104' href='?#2-104'>&nbsp;</a>Both these are the resultant types of consciousness, effects of good and evil 
Kamma.</p>

<p><a name='2-105' href='?#2-105'>&nbsp;</a>A soft touch, for instance, yields happiness. A pinprick, on the contrary, 
yields pain. In these cases one experiences the aforesaid two types of 
consciousness respectively. </p>

<p><a name='2-106' href='?#2-106'>&nbsp;</a>Now a question arises - Why only the body-consciousness is associated with 
happiness and pain? Why not the other sense-impressions? </p>

<p><a name='2-107' href='?#2-107'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-108' href='?#2-108'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Aung provides an answer in his introductory essay to the Compendium: -</p>

<p><a name='2-109' href='?#2-109'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;The sense of touch alone is accompanied by the positive hedonic elements of 
pain and pleasure; the other four senses are accompanied by hedonic 
indifference. This exceptional distinction is assigned to the sense of touch, 
because the impact between the sentient surface <i>(pasāda rūpa) </i>and the 
respective objects of other senses, both sets of which are secondary qualities 
of body, is not strong enough to produce physical pain or pleasure. But in the 
case of touch there is contact with one or other, or all the three primary 
qualities (locality - <i>pathavī,</i> temperature - <i>tejo,</i>
pressure - <i>vāyo)</i> and this is strong enough to affect those primary 
qualities in the percipient&#39;s own body. Just as cotton wool on the anvil does 
not affect the latter, but a hammer striking cotton wool imparts its check to 
the anvil also.&#39;&#39; </p>

<p><a name='2-112' href='?#2-112'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-113' href='?#2-113'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of touch the impact is strong. The &quot;essentials&quot;, <i>pathavī, tejo</i> 
and <i>vāyo</i> (extension, heat, and motion) - <i>āpo,</i> cohesion, is 
excluded being intangible - forcibly and directly strike against the essentials 
of the body. Consequently there is either pain or happiness. In the case of 
seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting, there is a bare impact. The consequent 
feeling is neither pain nor happiness. </p>

<p><a name='2-114' href='?#2-114'>&nbsp;</a>Although these sense-impressions may be <i>sukha, dukkha,</i> or <i>upekkhā</i>
the <i>javana</i> thought processes conditioned thereby may not necessarily be 
associated with a similar feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-115' href='?#2-115'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-116' href='?#2-116'>&nbsp;</a>For instance, the Buddha experienced a body-consciousness associated with 
pain when a rock splinter struck His foot, but His <i>javana</i> thought-process 
conditioned thereby would not necessarily be associate with displeasure. 
Unaffected by the pain, He would have experienced perfect equanimity. The 
immanent feeling in the stream of consciousness would have been <i>upekkhā.</i> 
Similarly at the sight of the Buddha, a right-understanding person would 
automatically experience an eye-consciousness associated with indifference <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata cakkhu-viññāna)</i> but his <i>javana</i>
thought would be moral. The innate feeling would be pleasure <i>(somanassa). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-117' href='?#2-117'>&nbsp;</a>This intricate point should be clearly understood. </p>

<p><a name='2-118' href='?#2-118'>&nbsp;</a><i>Somanassa</i> (good-mindedness ) and <i>domanassa</i>
(bad-mindedness) are purely mental. </p>

<p><a name='2-119' href='?#2-119'>&nbsp;</a>These five kinds of feeling could be reduced to three, the three to two, and 
the two to one as follows:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <p><a name='2-120' href='?#2-120'>&nbsp;</a>i. <i>sukha + somanassa; upekkhā; dukkha + domanassa </p>

    <li><p><a name='2-123' href='?#2-123'>&nbsp;</a>iv. <i>dukkha</i> </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='2-124' href='?#2-124'>&nbsp;</a><i>(Upekkhā</i> is merged in <i>sukha,</i> and <i>sukha</i> is ultimately 
merged in <i>dukkha).</i> </p>

<p><a name='2-125' href='?#2-125'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-126' href='?#2-126'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Sukha</b> - physical happiness should be differentiated from <i>
somanassa</i>
- mental pleasure. So should <i>dukkha</i> - physical pain - be differentiated 
from <i>domanassa</i>
- mental displeasure. There is only one consciousness accompanied by <i>sukha.</i>
Similarly there is only one accompanied by <i>dukkha.</i> Both of them are the 
effects of good and bad actions respectively. </p>

<p><a name='2-127' href='?#2-127'>&nbsp;</a>When the Buddha, for instance, was injured by Devadatta Thera, He experienced 
a body-consciousness accompanied by pain. This was the result of a past evil 
action of His. When we sit on a comfortable seat we experience a body 
consciousness accompanied by happiness. This is the result of a past good 
action. All forms of physical pain and happiness are the inevitable results of 
our own Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='2-128' href='?#2-128'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-129' href='?#2-129'>&nbsp;</a>5. Readers will note that pleasurable types of consciousness exceed all 
others. As such during a life-time a person experiences more happy moments than 
painful ones. This does not contradict the statement that life is sorrow <i>
(dukkha). </i>Here <i>dukkha</i>
is not used in the sense of painful feeling but in the sense of oppression or 
impeding <i>(pīlana).
</i>A careful reading of the description of <i>dukkha,</i> given in the 
Dhammacakka Sutta will make the matter clear. </p>

<p><a name='2-133' href='?#2-133'>&nbsp;</a>7. There is displeasure only in the two types of consciousness connected with <i>

  <p><a name='2-168' href='?#2-168'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;The four Great Essentials <i>(Mahābhūta),</i> o Bhikkhus, are the causes<i>

  <p><a name='2-169' href='?#2-169'>&nbsp;</a>Here <i>hetu</i> is used in the sense of causal relation <i>(paccaya-hetu).
  </p>
  <p><a name='2-170' href='?#2-170'>&nbsp;</a></i>There is a subtle distinction between <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya.</i>
  The former signifies root <i>(mūla);</i> the latter, an aiding factor <i>
  (upakāraka dhamma).</i> <i>Hetu</i> is compared to the roots of a tree, and <i>
  paccaya</i> to manure, water and soil that aid its growth. </p>
  <p><a name='2-171' href='?#2-171'>&nbsp;</a>This distinction should be clearly understood. </p>
  <p><a name='2-172' href='?#2-172'>&nbsp;</a>It should also be noted that at times both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i>

<p><a name='2-180' href='?#2-180'>&nbsp;</a>10. All the <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are devoid of all roots. Hence they are 
neither moral nor immoral. They are regarded as unmoral. </p>

<p><a name='2-181' href='?#2-181'>&nbsp;</a>Seven of them are the resultants of immoral actions, eight of moral actions,

the other accompanied by restlessness <i>(uddhacca).</i> These are the only two 
types of consciousness that have one root, which is delusion. Being potentially 
weak, restlessness is powerless in determining a future birth. Both doubt and 
restlessness are regarded as two Fetters, the first of which is eradicated by 
the First Path, and the second by the Fourth Path of Sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='2-280' href='?#2-280'>&nbsp;</a>The type of consciousness one experiences at the moment of conception is 
termed <i>patisandhi citta.</i> It is so called because it links the past with 
the present. </p>

<p><a name='2-281' href='?#2-281'>&nbsp;</a>This <i>patisandhi citta,</i> also termed &#39;rebirth-consciousness,&#39; is 
conditioned by the powerful thought one experiences at the dying moment, and is 
regarded as the source of the present life-stream. In the course of one 
particular life there is only one <i>patisandhi citta.</i> The mental contents 
of <i>bhavanga,</i> which later arises an infinite number of times during one&#39;s 
lifetime, and of <i>cuti,</i> which arises only once at the final moment of 
death, are identical with those of <i>patisandhi. </i></p>

cause or condition of existence. </p>

<p><a name='2-285' href='?#2-285'>&nbsp;</a>One experiences only one thought-moment at any particular time. No two 
thought-moments coexist. </p>

<p><a name='2-286' href='?#2-286'>&nbsp;</a>Each thought-moment hangs on to some kind of object. No consciousness arises 
without an object, either mental or physical. </p>

<p><a name='2-287' href='?#2-287'>&nbsp;</a>When a person is fast asleep and is in a dreamless state he experiences a 
kind of consciousness which is more passive than active. It is similar to the 
consciousness one experiences at the initial moment of conception and at the 
final moment of death. This type of consciousness is in Abhidhamma termed <i>
bhavanga.</i> Like any other consciousness it also consists of three aspects - 
genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> static <i>(thiti)</i>
and cessation <i>(bhanga).</i> Arising and perishing every moment it flows on 
like a stream not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. </p>

<p><a name='2-288' href='?#2-288'>&nbsp;</a>When an object enters this stream through the sense-doors, the <i>bhavanga</i>
consciousness is arrested and another type of consciousness appropriate to the 
object perceived arises. Not only in a dreamless state but also in our waking 
state we experience
<i>bhavanga</i> thought-moments more than any other types of consciousness. 
Hence <i>bhavanga</i>
becomes an indispensable condition of life. </p>

<p><a name='2-289' href='?#2-289'>&nbsp;</a>Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. Aung compare <i>bhavanga</i> to &quot;Leibniz&#39;s state of 
obscure perception, not amounting to consciousness, in dreamless sleep.</p>

<p><a name='2-290' href='?#2-290'>&nbsp;</a>One cannot agree because <i>bhavanga</i> is a type of consciousness. There is 
no obscure perception here. </p>

<p><a name='2-291' href='?#2-291'>&nbsp;</a>Some identify <i>bhavanga</i> with sub-consciousness. According to the 
Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousness is &#39;&#39;a compartment of the mind 
alleged by certain psychologists and philosophers to exist below the threshold 
of consciousness.&quot; In the opinion of Western philosophers sub-consciousness and 
consciousness coexist. According to Abhidhamma no two types of consciousness 
coexist. Nor is <i>bhavanga</i> a sub-plane.</p>

<p><a name='2-292' href='?#2-292'>&nbsp;</a>The Compendium further states that &quot;bhavanga denotes a functional state (or 
moment ) of sub-consciousness. As such it is the sub-conscious state of mind - 
&#39;below the threshold&#39; of consciousness - by which we conceive continuous 
subjective existence as possible. Thus it corresponds to F. W. Myer&#39;s 
&#39;subliminal consciousness&#39;&quot;.(<font SIZE="2"> p.266)</font></p>

<p><a name='2-293' href='?#2-293'>&nbsp;</a>The Dictionary of Philosophy explains &#39;&#39;subliminal (sub, under + limen, the 
threshold) as allegedly unconscious mental processes especially sensations which 
lie below the threshold of consciousness.&quot; Strictly speaking, it does not 
correspond to subliminal consciousness either.</p>

<p><a name='2-294' href='?#2-294'>&nbsp;</a>There does not seem to be any place for <i>bhavanga</i> in Western 
Psychology.</p>

<p><a name='2-295' href='?#2-295'>&nbsp;</a><i>Bhavanga</i> is so called because it is an essential condition for 
continued subjective existence. </p>

<p><a name='2-296' href='?#2-296'>&nbsp;</a>Whenever the mind does not receive a fresh external object, one experiences a <i>
bhavanga</i> consciousness.* Immediately after a thought-process, too, there is 
a <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness. Hence it is called <i>vīthimutta</i> - 
process-freed. Sometimes it acts as a buffer between two thought-processes . </p>

thought-moment that immediately follows is called <i>bhavanga-calana, (bhavanga</i>
vibration). Subsequently another thought-moment arises and is called the <i>

(arresting <i>bhavanga).</i> Owing to the rapidity of the flow of <i>bhavanga</i> 
an external object does not immediately give rise to a thought-process. The 
original <i>bhavanga</i>
thought-moment perishes. Then the flow is checked. Before the actual transition 
of the <i>bhavanga</i>
it vibrates for one moment. When the <i>bhavanga</i> is arrested a 
thought-moment arises adverting the consciousness towards the object. If it is a 
physical object, the thought-moment is termed five-door cognition <i>

<p><a name='2-338' href='?#2-338'>&nbsp;</a>Here Javana means running. It is so called because in the course of a 
thought-process it runs consecutively for seven thought-moments or five, hanging 
on to an identical object. The mental states occurring in all these thought 
moments are similar, but the potential force differs.</p>

<p><a name='2-339' href='?#2-339'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-340' href='?#2-340'>&nbsp;</a>When the consciousness perceives a vivid object usually seven moments of 
Javana arise in the particular thought-process. In the case of death or when the 
Buddha performs the Twin Psychic Phenomenon <i>(Yamaka Pātihāriya)</i> only five 
thought moments arise. In the Supramundane Javana process the Path-consciousness 
arises only for one moment. </p>

<p><a name='2-341' href='?#2-341'>&nbsp;</a>This javana stage is the most important from a ethical standpoint. It is at 
this psychological stage that good or evil is actually done. Irrespective of the 
desirability or the undesirability of the object presented to the mind, one can 
make the Javana process good or bad. If, for instance, one meets an enemy, a 
thought of hatred will arise almost automatically. A wise and forbearing person 
might, on the contrary, harbour a thought of love towards him. This is the 
reason why the Buddha has stated in the Dhammapada (V. 165)</p>

occurs. The object of this thought-process may be (i) a Kamma (action) which one 
has performed in the course of one&#39;s life. One recollects the deed as if being 
renewed. Strictly speaking, it is a recurring of the consciousness which one has 
experienced while performing the action. Or it may be (ii) any symbol <i>
(kamma-nimitta) </i>which was conspicuous during the performance of the action. 
It may also be (iii) characteristic symbol of the place in which one is bound to 
be reborn<i> (gati nimitta)*</i>. Taking one of these three as the object, the 
rebirth-consciousness takes place in the future existence. The object of the <i>
bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> of that particular existence is similar to that of

<p><a name='2-620' href='?#2-620'>&nbsp;</a><b>73.</b> What is time? Strictly speaking, it is a mere concept which does 
not exist in an absolute sense. On the other hand what space is to matter, time 
is to mind. Conventionally we speak of past <i>(atīta),</i> present<i> 
(paccuppanna), </i>and future <i>(anāgata). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-621' href='?#2-621'>&nbsp;</a>Past is defined as that which has gone beyond its own state or the moments of 
genesis, development, and cessation <i>(attano sabhāvam uppādādikkhanam vā atītā 
atikkantā atītā). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-622' href='?#2-622'>&nbsp;</a>Present is that which on account of this and that reason enters, goes, exists 
above the moments of genesis etc. <i>(tam tam kāranam paticca uppādādikkhanam 
uddham pannā, gatā, pavattā = paccuppannā). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-623' href='?#2-623'>&nbsp;</a>Future is that which has not yet reached both states <i>(tadubhayam&#39; pi na 
āgatā sampattā). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-624' href='?#2-624'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma each consciousness consists of three phases - <i>
uppāda</i>
(genesis), <i>thiti</i> (development), and <i>bhanga</i> (dissolution or 
cessation). In the view of some commentators there is no intermediate <i>thiti</i> 
stage but only the stages of arising and passing away. Each thought-moment is 
followed by another. Time is thus the <i>sine qua non</i> of the succession of 
mental states. The fundamental unit of time is the duration of a thought-moment. 
Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleeting thought moments is such 
that within the brief duration of a flash of lightning there may be billions of 
thought-moments. </p>

<p><a name='2-625' href='?#2-625'>&nbsp;</a>Matter, which also constantly changes, endures only for seventeen 
thought-moments, being the time duration for one thought-process. </p>

<p><a name='2-626' href='?#2-626'>&nbsp;</a>Past is gone, Future has not come. We live only for one thought-moment and 
that slips into the irrevocable past. In one sense there is only the eternal 
NOW. In another sense the so-called present is the transitional stage from the 
future to the past.

<p><a name='2-627' href='?#2-627'>&nbsp;</a>The Dictionary of Philosophy defines time &quot;as the general medium in which all 
events take place in succession or appear to take place in succession.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='2-628' href='?#2-628'>&nbsp;</a>Atthasālini states that time is a concept derived from this or that 
phenomenon. And it does not exist in reality; it is merely a concept. <i>(Tam

<p><a name='2-736' href='?#2-736'>&nbsp;</a><b>97. </b>For instance, the eye-consciousness depends on the sensory surface 
of the eye but not on the physical organ or &#39;eye of flesh.&#39; The other 
sense-impressions also depend on their respective sensory surfaces. </p>

<p><a name='2-737' href='?#2-737'>&nbsp;</a>The sensory surfaces <i>(pasāda)</i> of these five organs should be 
understood as follows: -</p>

<p><a name='2-738' href='?#2-738'>&nbsp;</a><b>&quot;Cakkhu&quot;</b> which stands for vision, sense of sight and eye. &quot;Eye,&quot; 
however, is always in the present work to be understood as the seeing faculty or 
visual sense, and not as the physical or &#39;eye of flesh&#39; <i>(mamsa cakkhu).</i> 
The commentary gives an account of the eye, of which the following is the 
substance: First the aggregate organism <i>(sasambhāra-cakkhu):</i> a ball of 
flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by the socket bone beneath and by the bone of the 
eyebrow above, by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within and by 
the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, the 
six attributes dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form <i>
(santhānam),</i> and collocation <i>(sambhavo);
</i>vitality, sex, body-sensibility <i>(kāyappasādo),</i> and the visual 
sentient organ. The last four have their source in kamma. When &#39;the world, 
seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it only 
perceives the basis (or seat-<i>vatthu)</i>
of the eye. And this ball of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibers, is 
white, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent and the 
gaseous. It is white by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red 
by superfluity of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by 
superfluity of the liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent, quivering by 
superfluity of the gaseous. But that sentient organ <i>(pasādo)</i>
which is there bound, inherent, derived from the four great principles - this is 
the visual sense <i>(pasāda-cakkhu).</i> Placed in the midst and in the front of 
the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding it (note that 
the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the &#39;black disc&#39;) and in the 
circle of vision, in the region where the forms of adjacent bodies come to 
appear, it permeates the seven ocular membranes as sprinkled oil will permeate 
seven cotton wicks. And so it stands, aided by the four elements, sustaining, 
maturing, moving (samudīranam) - like an infant prince and four nurses, feeding, 
bathing, dressing, and fanning him - maintained by nutriment both physical <i>
(utu)</i> and mental, protected by the (normal) span of life, invested with 
colour, smell, taste, and so forth, in size the measure of a louse&#39;s head - 
stands duly constituting itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions etc. 
For as it has been said by the Commander of the Doctrine (Sāriputta): </p>

<p><a name='2-739' href='?#2-739'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;The visual sense by which he beholds forms</p>

<p><a name='2-760' href='?#2-760'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentators, <i>hadayavatthu</i> is the seat of 
consciousness. Tradition says that within the cavity of the heart there is some 
blood, and depending on which lies the seat of consciousness. It was this 
cardiac theory that prevailed in the Buddha&#39;s time, and this was evidently 
supported by the Upanishads. </p>

<p><a name='2-761' href='?#2-761'>&nbsp;</a>The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit 
Himself. </p>

<p><a name='2-762' href='?#2-762'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Aung in his Compendium argues that the Buddha was silent on this point. 
He did not positively assert that the seat of consciousness was either in the 
heart or in the brain. In the Dhammasangani the term <i>hadayavatthu</i> has 
purposely been omitted. In the Patthāna, instead of using hadaya as the seat of 
consciousness, the Buddha has simply stated <i>&#39;yam rūpain nissāya&#39;</i> - 
&#39;depending on that <i>rūpa.&#39;</i>
Mr. Aung&#39;s opinion is that the Buddha did not want to reject the popular theory. 
Nor did He advance a new theory that brain is the seat of consciousness as is 
regarded by modern scientists. </p>

existence. </p>

of eye. Then the <i>bhavanga-</i>consciousness vibrates for one moment and

five-door apprehending consciousness (iv) arises and ceases apprehending that 
very visible object. </p>

<p><a name='10-131' href='?#10-131'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma ordinarily there is no moment when we do not 
experience a particular kind of consciousness, hanging on to some object - 
whether physical of mental. The time-limit of such a consciousness is termed one 
thought-moment. The rapidity of the succession of such thought-moments is hardly 
conceivable by the ken of human knowledge. Books state that within the brief 
duration of a flash of lightning, or in the twinkling of an eye billions of 
thought-moments may arise and perish. </p>

<p><a name='10-132' href='?#10-132'>&nbsp;</a>Each thought-moment consists of three minor instants <i>(khanas).</i>
They are <i>uppāda</i> (arising or genesis), <i>thiti</i> (static or 
development), and <i>bhanga</i>
(cessation or dissolution). </p>

<p><a name='10-133' href='?#10-133'>&nbsp;</a>Birth, decay, and death* correspond to these three states. The interval 
between birth and death is regarded as decay. </p>

<p><a name='10-134' href='?#10-134'>&nbsp;</a>Immediately after the cessation stage of a thought-moment there results the 
genesis stage of the subsequent thought-moment. Thus each unit of consciousness 
perishes conditioning another, transmitting at the same time all its 
potentialities to its successor. There is, therefore, a continuous flow of 
consciousness like a stream without any interruption. </p>

<p><a name='10-135' href='?#10-135'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='10-136' href='?#10-136'>&nbsp;</a>[*<font SIZE="2">These three stages correspond to the Hindu view of Brahma 
(Creator). Vishnu (Preserver) and Siva (Destroyer).]</font></p>

<p><a name='10-137' href='?#10-137'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='10-138' href='?#10-138'>&nbsp;</a>When a material object is presented to the mind through one of the five 
sense-doors, a thought-process occurs, consisting of a series of separate 
thought-moments leading one to the other in a particular, uniform order. This 
order is known as the <i>citta-niyāma</i>
(psychic order). As a rule for a complete perception of a physical object 
through one of the sense-doors precisely 17 thought-moments must pass. As such 
the time duration of matter is fixed at 17 thought-moments. After the expiration 
of that time-limit, one fundamental unit of matter perishes giving birth to 
another unit. The first moment is regarded as the genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> the 
last as dissolution <i>(bhanga),</i> and the interval 15 moments as decay or 
development <i>(thiti</i> or<i> jarā). </i></p>

<p><a name='10-139' href='?#10-139'>&nbsp;</a>As a rule when an object enters the consciousness through any of the doors 
one moment of the life-continuum elapses. This is known as <i>atīta-bhavanga.</i>
Then the corresponding thought-process runs uninterruptedly for 16 
thought-moments. The object thus presented is regarded as &#39;very great.&#39; </p>

<p><a name='10-140' href='?#10-140'>&nbsp;</a>If the thought-process ceases at the expiration of <i>javanas</i>
without giving rise to two retentive moments <i>(tadālambana), </i>thus 
completing only 14 moments, then the object is called &#39;great&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='10-141' href='?#10-141'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes the thought-process ceases at the moment of determining <i>
(votthapana)</i>
without giving rise to the <i>javanas,</i> completing only 7 thought-moments 
Then the object is termed &#39;slight.&#39; </p>

<p><a name='10-142' href='?#10-142'>&nbsp;</a>At times when an object enters the consciousness there is merely a vibration 
of the life-continuum. Then the object is termed &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p><a name='10-143' href='?#10-143'>&nbsp;</a>When a so-called &#39;very great&#39; or &#39;great&#39; object perceived through the five 
sense-doors, is subsequently conceived by the mind-door, or when a thought 
process arising through the mind-door extends up to the retentive stage, then 
the object is regarded as &#39;clear&#39;.</p>

<p><a name='10-144' href='?#10-144'>&nbsp;</a>When a thought process, arising through the mind-door, ceases at the javana 
stage, the object is termed &#39;obscure&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='10-145' href='?#10-145'>&nbsp;</a>When, for instance, a person looks at the radiant moon on a cloudless night, 
he gets a faint glimpse of the surrounding stars as well. He focuses his 
attention on the moon, but he cannot avoid the sight of stars around. The moon 
is regarded as a great object, while the stars are regarded as minor objects. 
Both moon and stars are perceived by the mind at different moments. According to 
Abhidhamma it is not correct to say that the stars are perceived by the 
sub-consciousness and the moon by the consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='10-203' href='?#10-203'>&nbsp;</a>Venerable Buddhaghosa defines <i>&#39;appanā&#39;</i> as the directing or fixing of 
the one-pointed consciousness on an object <i>(ekaggam cittam ārammane appenti). </i></p>

<p><a name='10-204' href='?#10-204'>&nbsp;</a>Appanā is a highly developed form of <i>vitakka</i> - initial application of 
the mind, one of the <i>jhāna</i> factors. </p>

<p><a name='10-205' href='?#10-205'>&nbsp;</a>The aspirant who wishes to develop <i>jhānas</i> takes for his object a 
suitable subject, according to his temperament. In the course of his 
meditations, as mentioned in the first chapter, he arrives at a stage when he 
would be able to experience the first jhānic ecstasy. </p>

<p><a name='10-206' href='?#10-206'>&nbsp;</a>Then a thought-process runs as follows -</p>

<p><a name='10-210' href='?#10-210'>&nbsp;</a>The first is the mind-door consciousness, which precedes the <i>javana</i>
stage, conditioned by objects that enter the avenue of consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='10-211' href='?#10-211'>&nbsp;</a>The initial thought-moment of the <i>appanā javana</i>-process is termed <i>
parikamma</i> because it is a preparation for the desired higher consciousness 
whether Sublime <i>(mahaggata)</i> or Supramundane <i>(lokuttara).</i> This is 
followed by another thought-moment known as <i>upacāra</i> because it arises in 
proximity to the higher consciousness. Ordinarily these two thought-moments 
arise at the beginning of the <i>appanā javana</i>-process, but if the person is 
morally advanced only <i>upacāra</i> moment arises without the initial <i>
parikamma</i> moment. </p>

<p><a name='10-212' href='?#10-212'>&nbsp;</a>The third thought-moment is known as <i>anuloma</i> because it arises in 
harmony with the preceding thought moments and the following <i>gotrabhū</i> 
thought moment. <i>Gotrabhū,</i> literally, means that which overcomes the 
Sense-sphere lineage or that which develops the sublime or exalted lineage. 
Immediately after this <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment arises the <i>appanā</i> <i>jhāna</i> thought-moment. Absolute 
one-pointedness of the mind is gained at this advanced stage of mental 
development. </p>

<p><a name='10-213' href='?#10-213'>&nbsp;</a>The fully undeveloped <i>jhāna,</i> present in the preliminary

above it depends on the moral advancement of the person. Here <i>gotrabhū</i>

the supramundane lineage. </p>

<p><a name='10-218' href='?#10-218'>&nbsp;</a>One of the four <i>kāmāvacara</i> moral <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by 
knowledge, arises in these preliminary stages. The object of the first three 
thought-moments is mundane but the object of the <i>gotrabhū</i> is supramundane 
Nibbāna. Nevertheless, this developed thought-moment is incapable of eradicating 
the innate defilements. It is the <i>magga</i> (Path) consciousness that 
immediately follows, which performs the double function of intuiting Nibbāna and 
of eradicating the defilements. It should be noted that the Path consciousness 
occurs only once. This is immediately followed by two moments of <i>phala</i> 
(Fruit) consciousness if <i>parikamma</i>
is present. Otherwise there will be three <i>phala</i> thought-moments. </p>

<p><a name='10-219' href='?#10-219'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of the second, third, fourth, stages of Sainthood-the fourth 
thought-moment is named <i>vodāna,</i> which means purification, instead of <i>
gotrabhū.</i>
If the <i>parikamma</i> thought-moment precedes, <i>vodāna</i> thought-moment 
arises as the fourth, otherwise as the third. </p>

<p><a name='10-220' href='?#10-220'>&nbsp;</a>Each of the four Supramundane Paths arises only once in the course of one&#39;s 
life. But one may experience the Fruit consciousness even for a whole day 
continuously. The three lower fruits, Sotāpatti, Sakadāgāmi, and Anāgāmi are 
preceded by a moral <i>javana.</i> When one enjoys the Fruit of Arahatship the <i>
javanas</i> that immediately precede must be functionals because an Arahat, 
being an <i>Asekha</i> does not experience moral <i>javanas.</i> </p>

<p><a name='10-248' href='?#10-248'>&nbsp;</a>§ 9. Here, under all circumstances (i.e., in both sense-door and mind-door) 
when an object (12) is undesirable, the five sense-impressions, reception, 
investigation, retention (that arise) are immoral resultants. If desirable, they 
are moral resultants. If the object is extremely desirable, investigation and 
retention are accompanied by pleasure.</p>

<p><a name='10-249' href='?#10-249'>&nbsp;</a>In this connection, at the end of functional javanas accompanied by pleasure, 
there arise retentive thought-moments also accompanied by pleasure. At the end 
of functional <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by equanimity, the retentive thought 
moments are also accompanied by equanimity. </p>

<p><a name='10-250' href='?#10-250'>&nbsp;</a>But at the end of javanas, accompanied by displeasure, the retentive thought- 
moments and the <i>bhavangas</i> are also accompanied by indifference. Hence to 
one whose rebirth-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure, if, at the end of 
javanas, accompanied by displeasure, retentive thought-moments do not arise, 
then, there arises an investigating consciousness accompanied by indifference, 
hanging on to some sense-object with which one is familiar before. Immediately 
after, the teachers say there is subsidence into the life-continuum.</p>

<p><a name='10-251' href='?#10-251'>&nbsp;</a>Likewise they expect retention at the end of Sense-sphere <i>javanas</i>
to the Sense-sphere beings, only when Sense-sphere phenomena become objects. </p>

<p><a name='10-253' href='?#10-253'>&nbsp;</a>§ 10. Retention occurs, they say, in connection with &#39;clear&#39; and &#39;very great&#39;

<p><a name='10-257' href='?#10-257'>&nbsp;</a>12. Objects - ārammana</b></p>

<p><a name='10-258' href='?#10-258'>&nbsp;</a>The desirability or undesirability of an object is determined not according 
to individual temperament, but according to its intrinsic nature. The resultant 
consciousness conditioned thereby is regarded as the effect of one&#39;s good or bad 
action. </p>

<p><a name='10-259' href='?#10-259'>&nbsp;</a>The sight of the Buddha will perhaps be repulsive to a staunch heretic. His <i>
javana</i> thoughts will naturally be unwholesome. But the passive wholesome 
resultant eye-consciousness, caused by a past good kamma, is a <i>kusala vipāka.</i> 
This
<i>vipāka</i> is not conditioned by his will, but is an inevitable consequence. 
The <i>javana</i>
process, on the contrary, is conditioned by his own will. </p>

<p><a name='10-260' href='?#10-260'>&nbsp;</a>Again, for instance, the mere sight of excreta will be a source of delight to 
an ordinary dog. The object is generally undesirable and is a bad effect <i>
(akusala vipāka), </i>but the <i>javana</i> process caused thereby will be 
wholesome to the dog. The accompanying feeling will also be pleasurable. </p>

<p><a name='10-261' href='?#10-261'>&nbsp;</a>Although even an Arahat experiences an <i>akusala vipāka</i> at the sight of 
an undesirable object, his <i>javana</i> process will neither be wholesome nor 
unwholesome. The accompanying feeling will be one of equanimity. </p>

<p><a name='10-262' href='?#10-262'>&nbsp;</a>Now, when an undesirable object is presented either through the mind-door or 
five sense-doors, the sense-impressions, reception, investigation, retention 
that occur in the respective thought-processes, are all bad effects <i>(akusala 
vipākas).</i>
The accompanying feeling is invariably <i>upekkhā,</i> except in the case of 
body-impression which is <i>dukkha.</i> These thought-moments are the inevitable 
results of past bad actions. </p>

<p><a name='10-263' href='?#10-263'>&nbsp;</a>If the presented object is desirable, then the afore-said thought-moments are 
all good effects<i> (kusala vipākas). </i>Here too the accompanying feeling is <i>
upekkhā,</i> except in the case of body-impression which is <i>sukha.</i>
All these thought-moments are the results of past good actions. </p>

<p><a name='10-264' href='?#10-264'>&nbsp;</a>When the object is extremely desirable, the feeling of the <i>santīrana</i>
moment differs. Instead of <i>upekkhā</i> it is <i>somanassa. </i></p>

<p><a name='10-265' href='?#10-265'>&nbsp;</a>The <i>tadārammanas</i> followed by Sense sphere functional <i>javanas,</i>
accompanied by pleasure, are also associated with a similar feeling. Likewise 
the <i>upekkhā javanas</i> are followed by <i>upekkhā tadārammanas.</i></p>

<p><a name='10-266' href='?#10-266'>&nbsp;</a>As a rule the preceding <i>javanas</i> and the subsequent <i>tadārammanas</i>
possess a similar feeling. Somanassa is followed by <i>somanassa,</i> and <i>
upekkhā</i>
by <i>upekkhā.</i> </p>

<p><a name='10-267' href='?#10-267'>&nbsp;</a>What happens when the javanas are accompanied by domanassa as there are no <i>
domanassa tadārammanas? </i></p>

<p><a name='10-268' href='?#10-268'>&nbsp;</a>If the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta) </i>of the person is 
accompanied by <i>somanassa,</i> then when <i>javanas</i> are accompanied by <i>
domanassa,</i>
the <i>tadārammanas,</i> if they occur, will be accompanied by equanimity <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata),
</i>but if <i>tadārammanas</i> do not occur, then an adventitious <i>upekkhā</i> <i>
santīrana,</i>
without any special function, will intervene for one moment. This adventitious 
thought-moment is technically termed <i>āgantukabhavanga.</i> Usually the object 
of the <i>javanas</i>
and that of the <i>tadārammanas</i> are identical. But in this particular case 
the objects differ. The object of this <i>santīrana</i> is another <i>kāmāvacara</i> 
object with which one is familiar in the course of one&#39;s life. This object is 
termed <i>paritta</i>
(smaller or lesser) in comparison with the higher <i>rūpa, arūpa</i> and <i>
lokuttara</i>
objects. </p>

<p><a name='10-269' href='?#10-269'>&nbsp;</a>If, on the other hand, the rebirth-consciousness is not associated with
<i>somanassa,</i> then the <i>tadārammanas</i> therein become <i>upekhā</i> as 
are the <i>bhavangas</i>
that follow. </p>

<p><a name='10-270' href='?#10-270'>&nbsp;</a>It should be noted that <i>tadārammanas</i> occur only at the end of <i>
kāmāvacara</i>

<p><a name='10-302' href='?#10-302'>&nbsp;</a>As it is difficult to give an adequate English rendering for <i>javana,</i>
the Pāli term has been retained here. </p>

<p><a name='10-303' href='?#10-303'>&nbsp;</a>Both psychologically and ethically <i>javana</i> thought-moments are the most 
important, as both good and evil are determined at this stage. </p>

<p><a name='10-304' href='?#10-304'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes the <i>javanas</i> last only for one moment. At times they may 
continue for seven moments at the most. </p>

<p><a name='10-305' href='?#10-305'>&nbsp;</a><i>Kāmāvacara javanas,</i> as a rule, last only for six or seven moments. 
When one is in a senseless state or is about to die, <i>javanas</i> are confined 
to five moments. </p>

<p><a name='10-306' href='?#10-306'>&nbsp;</a>When the Buddha, by His psychic powers, emits fire and water, almost 
simultaneously, from His body, only four or five <i>javana</i> thought-moments 
arise so as to reflect on the <i>jhāna</i> factors, which is a prerequisite, for 
the performance of this &#39;Twin Psychic Phenomenon&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='10-307' href='?#10-307'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of a yogi who develops the first <i>jhāna</i> for the first time, <i>
javana</i> lasts only for one moment. So is it with those who develop the five <i>
abhiññās</i> - namely, i. Psychic Powers <i>(Iddhividha),</i> ii. Celestial Ear
<i>(Dibba Sota),</i> iii. Celestial Eye <i>(Dibba Cakkhu),</i> iv. Reading of 
Others&#39; Thoughts <i>(Paracittavijānana),</i> and v. Reminiscence of Previous 
Births <i>(Pubbe-nivāsānussati ñāna). </i>The four classes of supramundane <i>
javana</i> Path-consciousness also last for one moment only. It is at this great 
moment that Nibbāna is intuited. </p>

<p><a name='10-311' href='?#10-311'>&nbsp;</a>An Anāgāmi or an Arahat, who has developed the <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa 
jhānas,</i> could, by will-power, temporarily arrest the ordinary flow of 
consciousness even for seven days continuously. When one attains this state, all 
mental activities cease, although there exist heat and life devoid of any 
breathing. The difference between a corpse and one in this state, is that the 
latter possesses life. Books state too that his body cannot be harmed. The 
attainment of such an ecstatic state is known as <i>nirodha</i>
<i>samāpatti. Nirodha</i> means cessation, and <i>samāpatti</i> is attainment. </p>

<p><a name='10-312' href='?#10-312'>&nbsp;</a>Immediately prior to the attainment of this state he experiences for two 
moments the fourth <i>arūpa jhāna</i> (state of neither perception nor 
non-perception). The flow of consciousness then ceases until he emerges 
therefrom as determined by him. As a rule he remains in this state for about a 
week. Motionless he abides in this ecstasy. Books relate an incident of a 
Pacceka Buddha whose body was set fire to while in this state. But he was not 
affected thereby. </p>

<p><a name='10-313' href='?#10-313'>&nbsp;</a>Now when he emerges from this state the first thought-moment to arise is an 
Anāgāmi Fruit-consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat 
Fruit-consciousness in the case of an Arahat. Thereafter the stream of 
consciousness subsides into bhavanga.</p>

<h2>Summary of Rebirth Procedure</h2>

<p><a name='8-22' href='?#8-22'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-23' href='?#8-23'>&nbsp;</a>§1. Thus, according to thought-processes, the life&#39;s course (extending from 
birth to decease) has been explained. Now the summary of the procedure at 
rebirth will be told. </p>

<p><a name='8-24' href='?#8-24'>&nbsp;</a>§2. In the summary of process-freed consciousness, four sets of four should 
be understood as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) four planes of life (1); </li>
  <li>(ii) four modes of rebirth; </li>
  <li>(iii) four kinds of actions; </li>
  <li>(iv) fourfold advent of death. </li>
</ul>

<h3>i. Four Planes of Life</h3>

<p><a name='8-25' href='?#8-25'>&nbsp;</a>Of these, the four planes of life are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Unhappy plane (2); </li>
  <li>2. Sensuous blissful plane (3); </li>
  <li>3. Rūpavācara plane (4); </li>
  <li>4. Arūpavācara plane (5). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-26' href='?#8-26'>&nbsp;</a>Among these the Unhappy plane is fourfold - namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) Woeful State (6), </li>
  <li>(ii) Animal Kingdom (7), </li>
  <li>(iii) Peta Sphere (8), </li>
  <li>(iv) the Host of Asuras (9). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-27' href='?#8-27'>&nbsp;</a>The Sensuous blissful plane is sevenfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) Human Realm ( 10),
  </li>
  <li>(ii) the Realm of the Four Kings (11), </li>
  <li>(iii) the Realm of the Thirty-three gods (12), </li>
  <li>(iv) the Realm of the Yāma gods (13), </li>
  <li>(v) the Delightful Realm (14), </li>
  <li>(vi) the Realm of the gods who rejoice in (their own) creations (15),&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li>(vii) the Realm of the gods who lord over the creations of others (16). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-28' href='?#8-28'>&nbsp;</a>These eleven kinds of sphere constitute the Kāmāvacara plane. </p>

<p><a name='8-29' href='?#8-29'>&nbsp;</a>The Rūpavācara plane is sixteen fold - namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) the first jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>1. the Realm of Brahma&#39;s Retinue, </li>
    <li>2. the Realm of Brahma&#39;s Ministers,</li>
    <li>3. the Mahā Brahmā Realm (17); </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(ii) the second jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>4. the Realm of Minor Lustre, </li>
    <li>5. the Realm of Infinite Lustre, and </li>
    <li>6. the Realm of Radiant Lustre; </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(iii) the third jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>7. the Realm of Minor Aura, </li>
    <li>8. the Realm of Infinite Aura, and </li>
    <li>9. the Realm of Steady Aura; </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(iv) the fourth jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>10. the Realm of Great Reward, </li>
    <li>11. the Realm of Mindless Beings (18), and </li>
    <li>12. the Pure Abodes (19). </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-30' href='?#8-30'>&nbsp;</a>The Pure Abodes are fivefold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. the Durable Realm, </li>
  <li>ii. the Serene Realm, </li>
  <li>iii. the Beautiful Realm, </li>
  <li>iv. the Clear-sighted Realm, and </li>
  <li>v. the Highest Realm. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-31' href='?#8-31'>&nbsp;</a>The Arūpāvacara plane (20) is fourfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) the Realm of Infinite Space, </li>
  <li>(ii) the Realm of Infinite Consciousness. </li>
  <li>(iii) the Realm of Nothingness, </li>
  <li>(iv) the Realm of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-32' href='?#8-32'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

*</a><font SIZE="2">.)</font>, or Once-Returners are born in any way. </p>

<p><a name='8-34' href='?#8-34'>&nbsp;</a>The Ariyas (those who have attained the four stages of Sainthood, all 
worldings are called Non-Ariyas) are not born in mindless Realms and Woeful 
States. In other planes are born both Ariyas and Non-Ariyas. </p>

<p><a name='8-36' href='?#8-36'>&nbsp;</a><b>1. Bhūmi. </b>derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>bhu,</i>
to be, lit., means a place where beings exist. </p>

<p><a name='8-37' href='?#8-37'>&nbsp;</a>According to Buddhism the earth, an almost insignificant speck in the 
universe, is not the only habitable world, and humans are not the only living 
beings, Infinite are world systems and so are living beings. Nor is &quot;the

<p><a name='8-40' href='?#8-40'>&nbsp;</a><b>2. Apāya</b> = <i>apa + aya.</i> That which is devoid of happiness is 
apāya. It is viewed both as a mental state and as a place. </p>

<p><a name='8-41' href='?#8-41'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-42' href='?#8-42'>&nbsp;</a>3. States where sense-pleasures abound. See p. <a HREF="#page10">*</a>.

<p><a name='8-45' href='?#8-45'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-46' href='?#8-46'>&nbsp;</a>6. <b>Niraya</b> = <i>ni + aya;</i> devoid of happiness. According to 
Buddhism there are several woeful states where beings atone for their evil 
kamma. They are not eternal hells where beings are subject to endless suffering. 
Upon the exhaustion of the evil Kamma there is a possibility for beings born in 
such states to be reborn in good states as the result of their past good 
actions. </p>

<p><a name='8-47' href='?#8-47'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-48' href='?#8-48'>&nbsp;</a>7. <b>Tiracchāna</b> = <i>tiro,</i> across; <i>acchāna,</i> going. Animals 
are so called because as a rule quadrupeds walk horizontally. Buddhist belief is 
that beings are born as animals on account of evil Kamma. There is, however, the 
possibility for animals to be born as human beings. Strictly speaking, it should 
be said that an animal may manifest itself in the form of a human being, or <i>
vice versa,</i>
just as an electric current can be manifested in the forms of light, heat, and 
motion successively - one not necessarily being evolved from the other. An 
animal may be born in a blissful state as a result of the good Kamma accumulated 
in the past. There are at times certain animals, particularly dogs and cats, who 
live a more comfortable life than even human beings. It is also due to their 
past good Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-49' href='?#8-49'>&nbsp;</a>It is one&#39;s Kamma that determines the nature of one&#39;s material form, which 
varies according to the skill or unskilfulness of one&#39;s actions. And this again 
depends entirely on the evolution of one&#39;s understanding of reality. </p>

<p><a name='8-50' href='?#8-50'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-51' href='?#8-51'>&nbsp;</a>8. <b>Peta</b> = <i>pa + ita;</i> lit., departed beings, or (those) 
absolutely devoid of happiness. They are not disembodied spirits or ghosts. 
Although they possess material forms, generally they are invisible to the 
physical eye. They have no plane of their own, but live in forests, dirty 
surroundings, etc. </p>

<p><a name='8-52' href='?#8-52'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-53' href='?#8-53'>&nbsp;</a>9. <b>Asura</b> - lit., those who do not sport or those who do not shine. 
These Asuras should be distinguished from another class of Asuras who are 
opposed to Devas, and who live in the Tāvatimsa plane (see note 12). </p>

<p><a name='8-54' href='?#8-54'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-55' href='?#8-55'>&nbsp;</a>10. <b>Manussa</b> - lit., those who have an uplifted or developed mind
<i>(mano ussannam etesam). </i>Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>Manushya,</i> which 
means the sons of <i>Manu.</i> They are so called because they became civilized 
after <i>Manu</i>
the seer. </p>

<p><a name='8-56' href='?#8-56'>&nbsp;</a>The human realm is a mixture of both pain and happiness. Bodhisattas prefer 
the human realm, as they get a better opportunity to serve the world and perfect 
the requisites for Buddha hood. Buddhas are always born as human beings. </p>

<p><a name='8-57' href='?#8-57'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-58' href='?#8-58'>&nbsp;</a>11. <b>Cātummahārājika</b> - This is the lowest of the heavenly realms where 
the four Guardian Deities reside with their followers.</p>

<p><a name='8-59' href='?#8-59'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-60' href='?#8-60'>&nbsp;</a>12. <b>Tāvatimsa</b> - lit., thirty-three. Sakka, the king of the gods, 
resides in this celestial plane. The origin of the name is attributed to a story 
which states that thirty-three selfless volunteers led by Magha, having 
performed charitable deeds, were born in this heavenly realm. </p>

<p><a name='8-61' href='?#8-61'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-62' href='?#8-62'>&nbsp;</a>13. <b>Yāma </b>- derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>yam,</i>
to destroy. That which destroys pain is <i>yāma.</i></p>

<p><a name='8-63' href='?#8-63'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-64' href='?#8-64'>&nbsp;</a>14. <b>Tusita</b> - lit., happy-dwellers. Traditional belief is that the 
future Bodhisatta dwells at present in this celestial plane, awaiting the right 
opportunity to be born as a human being and become a Buddha. </p>

<p><a name='8-65' href='?#8-65'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-66' href='?#8-66'>&nbsp;</a>15. <b>Nimmānarati</b> - Those who delight in the created mansions. </p>

<p><a name='8-67' href='?#8-67'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-68' href='?#8-68'>&nbsp;</a>16. <b>Paranimmitavasavatti</b> - lit., those who bring under their sway 
things created by others. </p>

<p><a name='8-69' href='?#8-69'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-70' href='?#8-70'>&nbsp;</a>These are the six Celestial planes - all temporary blissful abodes - where 
beings are supposed to live happily enjoying fleeting pleasures of sense. 
Superior to these Sensuous planes are the Brahma realms where beings delight in 
jhānic bliss, achieved by renouncing sense-desires. </p>

<p><a name='8-71' href='?#8-71'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-72' href='?#8-72'>&nbsp;</a>17. These are the three Brahma realms where beings who have developed the 
first jhāna are born. The lowest of these three is Brahma Pārisajja, which, 
literally, means &quot;Those who are born amongst the attendants of Mahā-Brahmas.&quot; 
The second is Brahma Purohita which means Brahma&#39;s Ministers. The highest of the 
first three is Mahā Brahmā. It is so called because these beings exceed others 
in happiness, beauty and age-limit, owing to the intrinsic merit of their mental 
development. </p>

<p><a name='8-73' href='?#8-73'>&nbsp;</a>Those who develop the first jhāna to a normal extent are born in the first 
plane; those who have developed to a medium degree are born in the second; and 
those who have perfect control of the first jhāna are born amongst the Mahā 
Brahmas in the third plane. The three divisions of the other jhānic planes 
should be similarly understood. </p>

<p><a name='8-74' href='?#8-74'>&nbsp;</a>18. <b>Asasññasatta</b> - This is supposed to be a plane where beings are 
born without a consciousness. Here only a material flux exists, normally both 
mind and matter are inseparable. By the power of meditation it is possible, at 
times, to separate matter from mind as in this particular case. When Arahat 
attains the <i>Nirodha</i> <i>Samāpatti,</i>
his consciousness ceases to exist temporarily. Such a state is almost 
inconceivable to us. But there may be many inconceivable things which are actual 
facts. </p>

<p><a name='8-75' href='?#8-75'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-76' href='?#8-76'>&nbsp;</a>19. Suddhāvāsa - Only Anāgāmis and Arahats are found in these planes. Those 
who attain Anāgāmi in other planes are born in these Pure Abodes. Later, they 
attain Arahatship and live in those planes till their life-term is over. </p>

<p><a name='8-77' href='?#8-77'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-78' href='?#8-78'>&nbsp;</a>20. See p. <a HREF="#page11">*</a>. All these four are immaterial planes. </p>

<p><a name='8-79' href='?#8-79'>&nbsp;</a>It should be remarked that the Buddha did not attempt to expound any 
cosmological theory. </p>

<p><a name='8-80' href='?#8-80'>&nbsp;</a>The essence of the Buddha&#39;s teaching is not affected by the existence or 
non-existence of these planes. No one is bound to believe anything if it does 
not appeal to his reason. Nor is it right to reject anything just because it 
cannot be conceived by one&#39;s limited knowledge. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><a name='8-185' href='?#8-185'>&nbsp;</a>29. <b>Kamma,</b> Sanskrit Karma, lit. means action, of doing. Strictly 
speaking, Kamma means all moral and immoral volition (cetanā). It covers all 
that is included in the phrase - &quot;thought, word and deed&quot;. It is the law of 
moral causation. In other words, it is action and reaction in the ethical realm, 
or &quot;action influence&quot; as Westerners say. It is not fate or predestination. It is 
one&#39;s own doing reacting on oneself. </p>

<p><a name='8-186' href='?#8-186'>&nbsp;</a>Every volitional action, except that of a Buddha or of an Arahat, is called 
Kamma. The Buddhas and Arahats do not accumulate fresh Kamma as they have 
eradicated ignorance and craving, the roots of Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-187' href='?#8-187'>&nbsp;</a>Kamma is action, and Vipāka, fruit or result, is its reaction. It is the 
cause and the effect. Like a seed is Kamma. Vipāka (effect) is like the fruit 
arising from the tree. As we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime in this life or 
in a future birth. What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present 
or in the past. </p>

<p><a name='8-188' href='?#8-188'>&nbsp;</a>Kamma is a law in itself, and it operates in its own field without the 
intervention of an external independent ruling agency. </p>

<p><a name='8-189' href='?#8-189'>&nbsp;</a>Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its due effect. The cause 
produces the effect; the effect explains the cause. The seed produces the fruit; 
the fruit explains the seed; such is their relationship. Even so are Kamma and 
its effect: &quot;the effect already blooms in the cause&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='8-190' href='?#8-190'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma, Kamma constitutes the twelve types of immoral 
consciousness, eight types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere <i>
(kāmāvacara),</i>
five types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Forms <i>
(rūpāvacara), </i>and four types of moral consciousness pertaining to the 
Formless Realms <i>(arūpāvacara). </i></p>

<p><a name='8-191' href='?#8-191'>&nbsp;</a>The eight types of supramundane consciousness <i>(lokuttara citta)</i>
are not regarded as Kamma and <i>vipāka,</i> because they tend to eradicate the 
roots of Kamma that condition rebirth. In the supramundane consciousness wisdom <i>
(paññā)</i>
is predominant, while in the ordinary types of consciousness volition <i>
(cetanā)</i> is predominant. </p>

<p><a name='8-192' href='?#8-192'>&nbsp;</a>These twenty-nine types of consciousness are called Kamma because the 
reproductive power is inherent in them. Just as every object is accompanied by a 
shadow, even so every volitional activity is accompanied by its due effect. </p>

<p><a name='8-193' href='?#8-193'>&nbsp;</a>These types of consciousness that are experienced as inevitable consequences 
of good and bad thoughts, are called resultant consciousness <i>(vipāka).</i>
The 23 types (7+8+8) of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere, 
the five types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Form, and 
the four types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Formless Realms, are 
called <i>vipāka</i> or fruition of Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-194' href='?#8-194'>&nbsp;</a>(See The Life of the Buddha and his Teachings, pp. 333-391, and Manual of 
Buddhism, pp. 19-88)</p>

<p><a name='8-195' href='?#8-195'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-196' href='?#8-196'>&nbsp;</a>30. Every birth is conditioned by a past good or bad Kamma which predominates 
at the moment of death. The Kamma that conditions the future birth is called 
Reproductive (Janaka) Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-197' href='?#8-197'>&nbsp;</a>The death of a person is merely &quot;the temporary end of a temporary 
phenomenon&quot;. Though the present form perishes, another form which is neither the 
same nor absolutely different, takes its place according to the potential 
thought-vibrations generated at the death moment, as the Kammic force which 
propels the life-flux still survives. It is this last thought, which is 
technically called Reproductive Kamma, that determines the state of a person in 
his subsequent birth. This may be either a good or bad Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-198' href='?#8-198'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-199' href='?#8-199'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentary, Janaka Kamma is that which produces mental 
aggregates and material aggregates at the moment of conception. The initial 
consciousness, which is termed the <i>patisandhi viññāna</i> 
(rebirth-consciousness), is conditioned by this Janaka Kamma. Simultaneous with 
the arising of the rebirth-consciousness there arise the body-decade, 
sex-decade, and base-decade <i>(kāya-bhāva-vatthu dasaka). </i></p>

<p><a name='8-200' href='?#8-200'>&nbsp;</a>The body-decade is composed of the four elements - namely,  </p>

<ul>
  <li>the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> </li>
  <li>the element of cohesion <i>(āpo), </i></li>
  <li>the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> </li>
  <li>the element of motion <i>(vāyo);</i> </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-201' href='?#8-201'>&nbsp;</a>their four derivatives <i>(upādārūpa) </i>- namely,  </p>

<ul>
  <li>colour <i>(vanna),</i> </li>
  <li>odour <i>(gandha),</i> </li>
  <li>taste <i>(rasa),</i> </li>
  <li>nutritive essence <i>(ojā);</i> </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-202' href='?#8-202'>&nbsp;</a>vitality <i>(jīvitindriya),</i> and body <i>(kāya). </i>The sex-decade and 
the base-decade also consist of the first nine plus sex <i>(bhāva)</i> and seat 
of consciousness <i>(vatthu) </i>respectively.</p>

<p><a name='8-203' href='?#8-203'>&nbsp;</a>From this it is evident that the sex is determined at the very conception of 
a being. I t is conditioned by Kamma and is not a fortuitous combination of 
sperm and ovum cells. Pain and happiness, which one experiences in the course of 
one&#39;s lifetime, are the inevitable consequences of Janaka Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-204' href='?#8-204'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-205' href='?#8-205'>&nbsp;</a>31. <b>Upatthambhaka</b> - that which comes near the Reproductive Kamma and 
supports it. It is either good or bad, and it assists or maintains the action of 
the Reproductive Kamma in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. Immediately after the 
conception till the death moment, this Kamma steps forward to support the 
Reproductive Kamma. A moral Supportive Kamma assists in giving health, wealth, 
happiness, etc., to the person concerned. An immoral Supportive Kamma, on the 
other hand, assists in giving pain, sorrow, etc., to the person born with an 
immoral Reproductive Kamma as, for instance, to a beast of burden. </p>

<p><a name='8-206' href='?#8-206'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-207' href='?#8-207'>&nbsp;</a>32. <b>Upapīdaka</b> - Obstructive or Counteractive Kamma which, unlike the 
previous one, tends to weaken, interrupt and retard the fruition of the 
Reproductive Kamma. For instance, a person born with a good Reproductive Kamma 
maybe subject to various ailments, etc., thus preventing him from enjoying the 
blissful results of his good action. An animal, on the other hand, who is born 
with a bad Reproductive Kamma, may lead a comfortable life by getting good food, 
lodging, etc., as a result of his good Counteractive Kamma preventing the 
fruition of the evil Reproductive Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-208' href='?#8-208'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-209' href='?#8-209'>&nbsp;</a>33. <b>Upaghātaka</b> - According to the Law of Kamma the potential energy of 
the Reproductive Kamma could be nullified by a more powerful opposing Kamma of 
the past, which, seeking an opportunity, may quite unexpectedly operate, just as 
a counteractive powerful force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow and bring 
it down to the ground. Such an action is called Destructive Kamma, which is more 
effective than the previous two in that it not only obstructs but also destroys 
the whole force. This Destructive Kamma also may be either good or bad. </p>

<p><a name='8-210' href='?#8-210'>&nbsp;</a>As an instance of the operation of all four, the case of Devadatta, who 
attempted to kill the Buddha and who caused a schism in the Sangha, may be 
cited. His good Reproductive Kamma conditioned him a birth in a royal family. 
His continued comforts and prosperity were due to the action of the Supportive 
Kamma. The counteractive Kamma came into operation when he was subject to much 
humiliation as a result of his being excommunicated from the Sangha. Finally the 
Destructive Kamma brought his life to a miserable end. </p>

<p><a name='8-211' href='?#8-211'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-212' href='?#8-212'>&nbsp;</a>34. <b>Garuka</b> - which means either weighty or serious, may be either good 
or bad. It produces its results in this life, or in the next for certain. If 
good, it is purely mental as in the case of the <i>jhānas.</i> Otherwise it is 
verbal or bodily. The five kinds of immoral Weighty Kamma according to their 
gravity are: - (i) the creation of a schism in the Sangha, (ii) the wounding of 
a Buddha, (iii) the murder of an Arahat, (iv) matricide, and (v) parricide. </p>

<p><a name='8-213' href='?#8-213'>&nbsp;</a>These are also known as ānantariya Kamma because they definitely produce 
their effects in the subsequent life. Permanent Skepticism <i>(niyata 
micchāditthi)</i> is also termed one of the Weighty Kammas. </p>

<p><a name='8-214' href='?#8-214'>&nbsp;</a>If, for instance, any person were to develop the <i>jhānas</i> and later were 
to commit one of these heinous crimes, his good Kamma would be obliterated by 
the powerful evil Kamma. His subsequent birth would be conditioned by the evil 
Kamma in spite of his having gained the <i>jhānas</i> earlier. Devadatta lost 
his psychic powers and was born in an evil state, because he wounded the Buddha 
and caused a schism in the Sangha. </p>

<p><a name='8-215' href='?#8-215'>&nbsp;</a>King Ajātasattu would have attained the first stage of sainthood if he had 
not committed parricide. In this case the powerful evil Kamma acted as an 
obstacle to his gaining sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='8-216' href='?#8-216'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-217' href='?#8-217'>&nbsp;</a>35. <b>āsanna,</b> or Death-proximate Kamma, is that which one does or 
remembers immediately before the dying moment. Owing to its significance in 
determining the future birth, the custom of reminding the dying person of his 
good deeds and making him do good acts on his death-bed still prevails in 
Buddhist countries. </p>

<p><a name='8-218' href='?#8-218'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receive a good birth if 
fortunately he remembers or does a good act at the last moment. A story runs 
that a certain executioner, who casually happened to give some alms to the 
Venerable Sāriputta, remembered this good act at the dying moment and was born 
in a state of bliss. This does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth he 
will be exempt from the effects of the evil deeds accumulated during his 
lifetime. They will have their due effects as occasions arise. </p>

<p><a name='8-219' href='?#8-219'>&nbsp;</a>At times a good person may die unhappily by suddenly remembering an evil act 
of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought, perchance compelled by 
unfavourable circumstances. Queen Mallikā, the consort of King Pasenadi, led a 
righteous life, but as a result of remembering, at her death moment, a lie which 
she had uttered, she had to suffer for about seven days in a state of misery. </p>

<p><a name='8-220' href='?#8-220'>&nbsp;</a>These are only exceptional cases. Such reverse changes of birth account for 
the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and of vicious children to 
virtuous parents. As a rule the last thought-process is conditioned by the 
general conduct of a person. </p>

<p><a name='8-221' href='?#8-221'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-222' href='?#8-222'>&nbsp;</a>36. <b>ācinna Kamma</b> is that which one habitually performs and recollects 
and for which one has a great liking. </p>

<p><a name='8-223' href='?#8-223'>&nbsp;</a>Habits, whether good or bad, become second nature. They tend to form the 
character of a person. At leisure moments we often engage ourselves in our 
habitual thoughts and deeds. In the same way at the death-moment, unless 
influenced by other circumstances, we, as a rule, recall to mind such thoughts 
and deeds. </p>

<p><a name='8-224' href='?#8-224'>&nbsp;</a>Cunda, a butcher, who was living in the vicinity of the Buddha&#39;s Monastery, 
died squealing like a pig because he was earning his living by slaughtering 
pigs. </p>

<p><a name='8-225' href='?#8-225'>&nbsp;</a>King Dutthagāmani of Ceylon was in the habit of giving alms to the Bhikkhus 
before he took his meals. It was this habitual Kamma that gladdened him at the 
dying moment and gave him birth in the Tusita Realm.</p>

<p><a name='8-226' href='?#8-226'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-227' href='?#8-227'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Katattā</b> - Reserve or Cumulative Kamma. Literally, it means 
&quot;because done&quot;. All actions that are done once and soon forgotten belong to this 
category. This is as it were the reserve fund of a particular being. </p>

<p><a name='8-228' href='?#8-228'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-229' href='?#8-229'>&nbsp;</a>38. <b>Ditthadhammavedanāya Kamma</b> is that which is experienced in this 
particular life. <i>Ditthadhamma</i> means this present life. </p>

<p><a name='8-230' href='?#8-230'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma one does both good and evil during the <i>javana</i>
process which usually lasts for seven thought-moments. The effect of the first 
thought-moment, being the weakest, one may reap in this life itself. This is 
called the Immediately Effective Kamma. If it does not operate in this life, it 
is called Defunct or Ineffective <i>(ahosi).</i> The next weakest is the seventh 
thought-moment. Its evil effect one may reap in the subsequent birth. This is 
called <i>Upapajjavedanīya Kamma.</i>
This, too, becomes ineffective if it does not operate in the second birth. The 
effects of the intermediate thought-moments may take place at any time until one 
attains Nibbāna. This type of Kamma is known as Aparāpariyavedanīya - 
Indefinitely Effective. No one, not even the Buddhas and Arahats, is exempt from 
this class of Kamma, which one may experience in the course of one&#39;s wanderings 
in Samsāra. There is no special class of Kamma known as
<i>ahosi,</i> but when such actions that should produce their effects in the 
present life or in a subsequent life do not operate, they are termed 
Ineffective. </p>

<p><a name='8-231' href='?#8-231'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-232' href='?#8-232'>&nbsp;</a>39. <b>Bāhullavuttito</b> - This term is used because these actions may be 
done through the other doors as well. </p>

<p><a name='8-242' href='?#8-242'>&nbsp;</a>44. The evil effects of the twelve types of immoral consciousness are the 
seven types of rootless resultant consciousness. They may take effect in the

<p><a name='8-244' href='?#8-244'>&nbsp;</a>45. The desirable effects of moral actions are the eight types of Rootless 
resultant consciousness and the eight types of Beautiful resultant 
consciousness. The effects of the eight types of moral consciousness may not 
only serve as rebirth consciousness but also give rise to different types of 
resultant consciousness in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p><a name='8-246' href='?#8-246'>&nbsp;</a>46. <b>Ukkattha</b> - lit., up <i>(u)</i> drawn <i>(<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
kas). </i>A highest class of moral Kamma is that which is attended with good 
causes before and after the commission of the act. For instance, alms given to 
the most virtuous with righteously obtained wealth, with no later repentance, is 
considered a &#39;highest&#39; moral Kamma.</p>

consciousness with the three good roots. But, if he were to give to the vicious

an inferior Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-272' href='?#8-272'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-273' href='?#8-273'>&nbsp;</a>§ 11. The advent of death (51) is fourfold, namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) through the expiration of the age-limit (52), </li>
  <li>(ii) through the expiration of the (Reproductive) Kammic force (53) </li>
  <li>(iii) through the (simultaneous) expiration of both (54), and </li>
  <li>(iv) through (the intervention of a) Destructive Kamma (55). </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-274' href='?#8-274'>&nbsp;</a>Now, to those who are about to die, at the moment of death, by the power of 
Kamma, one of the following presents itself through any of the six doors: </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. a Kamma that produces rebirth in the subsequent birth enters (the 
  mind-door) according to circumstances (56); </li>
  <li>ii. an object (51) such as a pre-perceived form and the like, or anything 
  that was instrumental in the performance of the Kamma. </li>
  <li>iii. a symbolic destiny sign (58) that should be got and experienced in 
  the subsequent birth-place. </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='8-275' href='?#8-275'>&nbsp;</a>Thereafter attending to that object thus presented (59), the stream of 
consciousness, in accordance with the Kamma that is to be matured, whether pure 
or corrupted, and in conformity with the place where one is to be born, 
continually flows, inclining mostly towards that state. Or that 
birth-reproductive Kamma presents itself to a sense-door in the way of renewing. </p>

<p><a name='8-276' href='?#8-276'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-277' href='?#8-277'>&nbsp;</a>§ 12. To one who is nearing death, either at the end of a thought-process or 
at the dissolution of bhavanga, the decease-consciousness, the consummation of 
the present life, arises and ceases in the way of death. </p>

<p><a name='8-278' href='?#8-278'>&nbsp;</a>Immediately after that (death-consciousness) has ceased, a rebirth 
consciousness arises and is established in the subsequent existence, based on 
the object thus obtained, either with or without the heart-base (60) as is 
appropriate, generated by Kamma <i>(sankhāra)</i> that is enveloped by latent 
ignorance and rooted in latent craving. That rebirth (or relinking) 
consciousness, so called because it links together the two consecutive 
existences, is conjoined with its mental co-adjuncts, and acts as the 
fore-runner to the conascent states as their locus (or foundation - <i>
adhitthānabhāvena).
</p>

<p><a name='8-279' href='?#8-279'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

    </i><p><a name='8-280' href='?#8-280'>&nbsp;</a>§ 13. Herein in the dying thought-process only five feeble moments 
(normally seven thought-moments), of <i>javana</i> should be expected. </p>

<p><a name='8-281' href='?#8-281'>&nbsp;</a>Therefore when death occurs while the present object is being presented to 
the avenues (i.e., <i>kamma nimitta</i> to one of the five sense-doors or <i>
gati nimitta</i> to the mind-door) then the rebirth-consciousness and the <i>
bhavanga</i>-consciousness take a present object. </p>

<p><a name='8-282' href='?#8-282'>&nbsp;</a>Thus in rebirth in a Sense-Sphere the <i>kamma nimitta</i> taken by (any of) 
the six doors, or the <i>gati nimitta,</i> may be past or present. </p>

<p><a name='8-283' href='?#8-283'>&nbsp;</a>But Kamma is perceived by the mind-door only as a past object. </p>

<p><a name='8-284' href='?#8-284'>&nbsp;</a>All these should be regarded as lesser objects (i.e., belonging to the <i>
kāma</i>-sphere).
</p>

<p><a name='8-285' href='?#8-285'>&nbsp;</a>In rebirth in the Realms of Forms the Kamma symbol which is a concept (such 
as earth device, etc.) becomes the object. </p>

<p><a name='8-286' href='?#8-286'>&nbsp;</a>So, too, in rebirth in Formless Realms, only a Kamma symbol which is a 
sublimated concept (such as a visualized space) becomes an object, according to 
circumstances. </p>

<p><a name='8-287' href='?#8-287'>&nbsp;</a>To the mindless beings only the vital nonad* establishes itself in the way of 
rebirth. Hence they are called materially reborn. Those born in Formless Realms 
are called mentally reborn. The rest are called materially and mentally reborn. </p>

<p><a name='8-290' href='?#8-290'>&nbsp;</a>§ 14. After one passes away from a Formless Realm, one is similarly born in a 
Formless Realm, but not in a lower Formless plane, and also in the Sense-Sphere 
with three roots. </p>

<p><a name='8-291' href='?#8-291'>&nbsp;</a>When one passes from a Realm of Form, one is not born without the three

<p><a name='8-292' href='?#8-292'>&nbsp;</a>Herein this is the procedure with regard to decease and rebirth. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><a name='8-293' href='?#8-293'>&nbsp;</a>51. &quot;Death is the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon.&quot; By death is meant 
the extinction of psychic life <i>(jīvitindriya),</i> heat <i>(usma = 
tejodhātu),</i> and consciousness <i>(viññāna),</i> of one individual in a 
particular existence. Death is not the complete annihilation of a being. Death 
in one place means birth in another place, just as, in conventional terms, the 
rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another place. </p>

<p><a name='8-294' href='?#8-294'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-295' href='?#8-295'>&nbsp;</a>52. What are commonly understood to be natural deaths due to old age may be 
classed under this category. </p>

<p><a name='8-296' href='?#8-296'>&nbsp;</a>To each of the various planes of existence is naturally assigned a definite 
age-limit, irrespective of the potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma that 
has yet to run. One must, however, succumb to death when the maximum age-limit 
is reached. It may also be said that if the Reproductive Kamma is extremely 
powerful, the Karmic energy rematerializes itself on the same plane, or on some 
higher plane as in the case of the devas. </p>

<p><a name='8-297' href='?#8-297'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-298' href='?#8-298'>&nbsp;</a>53. As a rule the thought, volition, or desire, which was extremely strong 
during lifetime becomes predominant at the moment of death, and conditions the 
subsequent birth. In this last thought-moment is present a special potentiality. 
When the potential energy of this Reproductive Kamma is exhausted, the organic 
activities of the material form, in which is corporealized the life-force, cease 
even before the approach of old age. </p>

<p><a name='8-299' href='?#8-299'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-300' href='?#8-300'>&nbsp;</a>54. If a person is born at a time when the age-limit is 80 years, and he dies 
at 80 owing to the exhaustion of the potential force of his Reproductive Kamma, 
his death is due to the simultaneous expiration of both age and Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-301' href='?#8-301'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-302' href='?#8-302'>&nbsp;</a>55. There are powerful actions which suddenly cut off the force of the 
Reproductive Kamma, even before the expiration of the life-term. A more powerful 
opposing force, for instance, can check the path of a flying arrow and bring it 
down to the ground. Similarly, a very powerful Kammic force of the past is 
capable of nullifying the potential energy of the dying reproductive <i>(janaka)</i> 
thought-moment, and thus destroy the life of a being. The death of Devadatta was 
due to an <i>upacchedaka</i> <i>kamma</i> which he committed during his 
lifetime. </p>

<p><a name='8-303' href='?#8-303'>&nbsp;</a>The first three types of death are collectively called <i>kālamarana</i>
(timely death), and the last one is known as akālamarana (untimely death). </p>

<p><a name='8-304' href='?#8-304'>&nbsp;</a>An oil lamp, for instance, may be extinguished owing to any of the following 
four causes, namely, the exhaustion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, 
simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil, and some extraneous cause like the 
gust of a wind. Death of a person may similarly be caused by any of the 
aforesaid four ways.</p>

<p><a name='8-305' href='?#8-305'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-306' href='?#8-306'>&nbsp;</a>56. As a person is about to die, a good or bad action may present itself 
before his mind&#39;s eye. It may be either a meritorious or a demeritorious Weighty 
action <i>(garuka kamma), </i>such as <i>jhānas</i> (ecstasies), or parricide 
etc. They are so powerful that they totally eclipse all other actions, and 
appear very vividly before the mental eye. If there is no Weighty action, he may 
take for his object of the dying thought a Kamma done or remembered immediately 
before death <i>(āsanna kamma). </i></p>

<p><a name='8-307' href='?#8-307'>&nbsp;</a>If it is a past action, strictly speaking, it is the good or bad thought 
experienced at the moment of performing the action, that recurs at the 
death-moment. </p>

<p><a name='8-308' href='?#8-308'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-309' href='?#8-309'>&nbsp;</a>57. <b>Kamma nimitta</b> is any sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea 
which was obtained at the time of the commission of the Kamma, such as knives in 
the case of a butcher, patients in the case of a physician, flowers in the case 
of a devotee, etc. </p>

<p><a name='8-310' href='?#8-310'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-311' href='?#8-311'>&nbsp;</a>58. By <b>gati nimitta</b> is meant some sign of the place where he is to 
take birth, an event which invariably happens to dying persons. When these 
indications of the future birth occur, and if they are bad, they can be turned 
into good. This is done by influencing the thoughts of the dying person, so that 
his good thoughts may now act as the Proximate Kamma and counteract the 
influence of the Reproductive Kamma which would otherwise affect his subsequent 
birth. </p>

<p><a name='8-312' href='?#8-312'>&nbsp;</a>These symbols of one&#39;s destiny may be hellish fires, forests, mountainous 
regions, mother&#39;s womb, celestial mansions, etc. </p>

<p><a name='8-313' href='?#8-313'>&nbsp;</a>The Kamma is presented to the mind-door. <i>Kamma nimitta</i> may be 
presented to any of the six doors according to circumstances. <i>Gati nimitta,</i> 
being always a physical sight, is presented to the mind-door as a dream. </p>

<p><a name='8-314' href='?#8-314'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-315' href='?#8-315'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-316' href='?#8-316'>&nbsp;</a>59. Taking one of the aforesaid objects, a thought-process runs its course 
even if the death be an instantaneous one. It is said that even the fly which is 
crushed by a hammer on the anvil also experiences such a thought-process before 
it actually dies. </p>

<p><a name='8-317' href='?#8-317'>&nbsp;</a>Let us imagine for the sake of convenience that the dying person is to be 
reborn in the human plane and that his object is some good Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='8-318' href='?#8-318'>&nbsp;</a>His <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness, interrupted, vibrates for one 
thought-moment and passes away. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending 
consciousness <i>(manodvārāvajjana)</i>
arises and passes away. Then comes the psychologically important stage - the <i>
javana</i>
process - which here runs only for five thought-moments by reason of its 
weakness, instead of the normal seven. As such it lacks all reproductive power; 
its main function being the mere regulation of the new existence - <i>
abhinavakarana.</i> The object in the present case being desirable, the 
consciousness he experiences is a moral one - automatic or prompted, accompanied 
by pleasure, and associated with wisdom or as the case may be. The <i>
tadālambana</i>
consciousness which has for its function a registering or identifying for two 
moments of the object so perceived, may or may not follow. After this occurs 
death consciousness <i>(cuti citta), </i>the last thought-moment to be 
experienced in this present life. (See Diagram XI). </p>

<p><a name='8-319' href='?#8-319'>&nbsp;</a>There is a misconception amongst some that the subsequent birth is 
conditioned by this last decease-thought. What actually conditions rebirth is 
not this decease-thought, which in itself has no special function to perform, 
but that which is experienced during the <i>javana</i> process. </p>

<p><a name='8-320' href='?#8-320'>&nbsp;</a>With the ceasing of the decease-consciousness death actually occurs. Then no 
material qualities born of mind and food <i>(cittaja</i> and <i>āhāraja rūpa)</i>
are produced. Only series of material qualities born of heat <i>(utuja)</i> goes 
on till the corpse is reduced to dust. </p>

<p><a name='8-321' href='?#8-321'>&nbsp;</a>Now, immediately after the dissolution of the decease consciousness <i>(cuti 
citta)</i> there arises in a fresh existence the re-linking consciousness <i>
(patisandhi viññāna).</i> This is followed by sixteen <i>bhavanga</i> 
thought-moments. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending consciousness <i>
(manodvārāvajjana)</i> arises, to be followed by seven <i>javana</i> 
thought-moments, developing a liking to the fresh existence <i>(bhavanikanti 
javana). </i>Then the <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness arises and perishes, and the 
stream of consciousness flows on ceaselessly (see Diagram XII). </p>

<p><a name='8-322' href='?#8-322'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='8-323' href='?#8-323'>&nbsp;</a>60. In the case of Formless Realms there is no heart-base <i>(hadayavatthu).</i></p>

a stream (62), until the arising of the decease-consciousness (63). Being an 
essential factor of life, this consciousness is known as <i>bhavanga.</i> At the

particular existence are identical as they have the same object. The mental 
states in each of these three are the same. They differ only in name and in 
function. Immediately after the rebirth-consciousness <i>bhavanga</i>-consciousness 
arises. During lifetime, whenever no thought-processes arise, this <i>bhavanga</i> 
consciousness exists. One experiences innumerable <i>bhavanga</i>

of that particular life. </p>

</ul>

<p><a name='3-14' href='?#3-14'>&nbsp;</a>The sixth chapter is confined mainly to <i>rūpa</i> and Nibbāna.</p>

<p><a name='3-15' href='?#3-15'>&nbsp;</a>Twenty-eight species of Rūpa are enumerated. What they are, how they arise, 
persist, and perish, are also explained. <i>Rūpa</i> is the third <i>paramattha</i>
mentioned in the Abhidhamma, and is one of the two composite factors of this 
so-called being - the other being <i>nāma</i> (mind). As <i>nāma,</i> so <i>rūpa</i> 
too has been microscopically analysed. But no logical definition of <i>rūpa</i> 
is found either in the Text or in the Commentaries. </p>

<p><a name='3-16' href='?#3-16'>&nbsp;</a><i>Rūpa</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>rup, </i>to break 
up, to perish<i> (nāsa). </i></p>

<p><a name='3-17' href='?#3-17'>&nbsp;</a>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā, <i>rūpa</i> is that which transforms or 
assumes a different mode owing to the adverse physical conditions of cold heat, 
etc. <i>(sītonhādi virodhippaccayehi vikāram āpajjati). </p>

<p><a name='3-18' href='?#3-18'>&nbsp;</a></i>From a Buddhist standpoint <i>rūpa</i> not only changes but also perishes <i>
(khaya, vaya).</i> It endures only for seventeen thought-moments. <i>Rūpa</i>
changes so rapidly that one cannot strike an identical place twice. </p>

<p><a name='3-19' href='?#3-19'>&nbsp;</a><i>Rūpa</i> is also explained as that which manifests itself <i>(<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> 
rup - pakāsane).</i> </p>

<p><a name='3-20' href='?#3-20'>&nbsp;</a>Scholars suggest various renderings for <i>rūpa.</i> It is generally rendered 
by &#39;form&#39;, &#39;body&#39;, &#39;matter&#39;, &#39;corporeality&#39;, etc. meanings differ according to 
the context. One particular meaning is not universally applicable. </p>

<p><a name='3-21' href='?#3-21'>&nbsp;</a>From a philosophical standpoint, &#39;matter&#39; is the nearest equivalent for
<i>rūpa,</i> although scientists too find it difficult to define matter. </p>

<p><a name='3-22' href='?#3-22'>&nbsp;</a>It should be noted that the atomic theory prevailed in India in the time of 
the Buddha. <i>Paramānu</i> was the ancient term for the modern atom. According 
to the ancient belief one <i>ratharenu</i> consists of 36 <i>tajjāris;</i> one <i>
tajjāri,</i>
36 <i>anus;</i> one <i>anu,</i> 36 <i>paramānus.</i> The minute particles of 
dust seen dancing in the sunbeam are called <i>ratharenus.</i> One <i>paramānu</i> 
is therefore, 1/46, 656th part of a <i>ratharenu.</i> This <i>paramānu</i> was 
considered indivisible. </p>

<p><a name='3-23' href='?#3-23'>&nbsp;</a>With His supernormal knowledge the Buddha analysed this so-called <i>paramānu</i>
and declared that it consists of <i>paramatthas</i> - ultimate entities which 
cannot further be subdivided. </p>

<p><a name='3-24' href='?#3-24'>&nbsp;</a>The <i>paramatthas</i> are <i>pathavi, āpo, tejo,</i> and <i>vāyo.</i>
One must not understand that these elements are earth, water, fire and air, as 
some Greek thinkers believed in the past. </p>

<p><a name='3-25' href='?#3-25'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-26' href='?#3-26'>&nbsp;</a><b>Pathavi</b> means the element of extension, the substratum of matter. 
Without it objects cannot occupy space. The qualities of hardness and softness 
which are purely relative are two conditions of this particular element. It may 
be stated that this element is present in earth, water, fire and air. For 
instance, the water above is supported by water below. It is this element of 
extension in conjunction with the element of motion, that produces the upward 
pressure. Heat or cold is the <i>tejo</i>
element, while fluidity is the <i>āpo</i> element </p>

<p><a name='3-27' href='?#3-27'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-28' href='?#3-28'>&nbsp;</a><b>āpo</b> is the element of cohesion. Unlike pathavi it is intangible. It is 
this element that makes scattered particles of matter cohere, and gives rise to 
the idea of &#39;body&#39;. When solid bodies are melted, this element becomes more 
prominent in the resulting fluid. This element is found even in minute particles 
when solid bodies are reduced to powder. The elements of extension and cohesion 
are so closely interrelated that when cohesion ceases extension disappears. </p>

<p><a name='3-29' href='?#3-29'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-30' href='?#3-30'>&nbsp;</a><b>Tejo</b> is the element of heat. Cold is also a form of <i>tejo.</i>
Both heat and cold are included in <i>tejo</i> because they possess the power of 
maturing bodies, Tejo, in other words, is the vitalizing energy. Preservation 
and decay are also due to this element. Unlike the other three essentials of 
matter, this element has the power to regenerate matter by itself. </p>

<p><a name='3-31' href='?#3-31'>&nbsp;</a>Inseparably connected with heat is <b>vāyo,</b> the element of motion. 
Movements are caused by this element. Motion is regarded as the force or the 
generator of heat. &quot;Motion and heat in the material realm correspond 
respectively to consciousness and Kamma in the mental.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='3-32' href='?#3-32'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-33' href='?#3-33'>&nbsp;</a>These four elements coexist and are inseparable, but one may preponderate 
over another as, for instance, <i>pathavi</i> in earth, <i>āpo</i> in water,
<i>tejo</i> in fire, and <i>vāyo</i> in air. </p>

<p><a name='3-34' href='?#3-34'>&nbsp;</a>They are also called Mahābhūtas, or Great Essentials because they are 
invariably found in all material substances ranging from the infinitesimally 
small cell to the most massive object. </p>

<p><a name='3-35' href='?#3-35'>&nbsp;</a>Dependent on them are the four subsidiary material qualities of colour <i>
(vanna),</i>
smell <i>(gandha),</i> taste <i>(rasa),</i> and nutritive essence <i>(ojā).</i> 
These eight coexisting forces and qualities constitute one material group called <i>
&#39;suddhatthaka rūpa kalāpa</i> - pure-octad material group&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='3-36' href='?#3-36'>&nbsp;</a>The remaining twenty kinds of <i>rūpa</i> are equally important. </p>

<p><a name='3-37' href='?#3-37'>&nbsp;</a>It should be noted that physical life-principle <i>(rūpa jīvitindriya)</i> 
and sex are also conditioned by Kamma. Life in inorganic matter should be 
differentiated from life in animate beings. </p>

<p><a name='3-38' href='?#3-38'>&nbsp;</a>The fact that <i>rūpas</i> arise in four ways such as Kamma, mind, seasonal 
phenomena, and food, will be a novel idea to modern thinkers. All these four 
sources can, to a great extent, be brought under one&#39;s control. </p>

<p><a name='3-39' href='?#3-39'>&nbsp;</a>To some extent we are responsible for the creation of our own material 
phenomena, desirable or undesirable. </p>

<p><a name='3-40' href='?#3-40'>&nbsp;</a>The accumulated Karmic tendencies created by persons in the course of their 
previous lives, play at times a greater role than the hereditary parental cells 
and genes, in the formation of physical characteristics.</p>

<p><a name='3-41' href='?#3-41'>&nbsp;</a>The Buddha, for instance, inherited like every other person, the reproductive 
cells and genes from His parents. But physically there was none comparable to 
Him in His long line of honorable ancestors. In the Buddha&#39;s own words, He 
belonged not to the royal lineage, but to that of the Aryan Buddhas. He was 
certainly a superman, an extraordinary creation of His own Kamma.</p>

<p><a name='3-42' href='?#3-42'>&nbsp;</a>According to the Lakkhana Sutta (D. 30) the Buddha inherited these 
exceptional features, such as the 32 major marks, as the result of his past 
meritorious deeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical feature is 
clearly explained in the Sutta. </p>

<p><a name='3-43' href='?#3-43'>&nbsp;</a>In the sixth chapter only a few lines are devoted to the fourth <i>paramattha</i>
- Nibbāna - the <i>summum bonum</i> of Buddhism. But the path to Nibbāna is 
described in detail in the ninth chapter. </p>

<p><a name='3-44' href='?#3-44'>&nbsp;</a>The seventh chapter enumerates all ethical states and classifies them into 
various groups. </p>

<p><a name='3-45' href='?#3-45'>&nbsp;</a>The two most profound philosophical teachings of Buddhism - namely, the Law 
of Dependent Arising <i>(paticca-samuppāda)</i> and the twenty-four Causal 
Relations<i>
(Patthāna) </i>are described in the eighth chapter. </p>

<p><a name='3-46' href='?#3-46'>&nbsp;</a>The last chapter is the most important and the most interesting, as it deals 
with Mental Culture <i>(bhāvanā)</i> and Emancipation, the quintessence of 
Buddhism. </p>

<p><a name='3-47' href='?#3-47'>&nbsp;</a>To understand the intricacies of Abhidhamma one should critically read and 
reread the Abhidhammattha Sangaha patiently and carefully, pondering at the same 
time on the profound teachings embodied therein. </p>

<p><a name='3-48' href='?#3-48'>&nbsp;</a>One who understands the Abhidhamma well can fully comprehend the Word of the 
Buddha and thereby realize one&#39;s ultimate goal. </p>

qualities derived from them (9). These two constitute eleven species. </p>

<p><a name='3-82' href='?#3-82'>&nbsp;</a>How? </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p><a name='3-83' href='?#3-83'>&nbsp;</a>(1) Essential material qualities - the element of extension (10), the

its own characteristic marks. Element is the closest equivalent for <i>dhātu. 
Pathavi dhātu,</i> literally, means the earth-element. It is so called because 
like the earth it serves as a support or foundation for the other coexisting <i>

extend. So far, though not very satisfactory, the closest equivalent for <i>
pathavi-dhātu</i> is &#39;the element of extension&#39;. Without it objects cannot

pāy, </i>to grow, to increase. It is &#39;the element of cohesion . According to

thus prevents them from being scattered about. Both fluidity and contraction are 
the properties of this element. It should be understood that cold is not a 
characteristic of this element. </p>

of heat&#39;. <i>Tejo</i> is derived from<i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> tij,</i> 
to sharpen, to mature. Vivacity and maturity are due to the presence of this 
element. Both heat and cold are the properties of <i>tejo.</i> Intense <i>tejo</i> 
is heat, and mild <i>tejo</i>
is cold. It should not be understood that cold is the characteristic of <i>āpo</i> 
and heat is that of <i>tejo;</i> for, in that case, both heat and cold should be 
found together, as <i>āpo</i> and <i>tejo</i> coexist. </p>

<p><a name='3-132' href='?#3-132'>&nbsp;</a>14. <b>Pasāda-rūpa</b> - They are the sensitive parts of the five organs - 
eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. They tend to clarify the coexisting material 
qualities. The perceptible physical eye, for instance, is the <i>sasambhāra 
cakkhu</i> or composite eye, which consists of the four <i>bhūta-rūpas,</i> four <i>
upādā-rūpas</i>
(colour, odour, taste, and sap), and <i>jīvitindriya</i> (vitality). The 
sensitive part which lies at the center of the retina and which enables one to 
see objects is, the <i>cakkhu pasāda.</i> This is the basis of the 
eye-consciousness <i>(cakkhu-viññāna)</i> and becomes the instrument for the 
eye-door thought-process <i>(cakkhu-dvāravīthi).</i> The desire to see tends to 
develop the sense of sight. The eye, therefore, consists of ten material 
qualities of which <i>pasāda</i> is one.</p>

<p><a name='3-133' href='?#3-133'>&nbsp;</a>The other <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> should be similarly understood. </p>

<p><a name='3-134' href='?#3-134'>&nbsp;</a>The <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> of ear, nose, and tongue are in their respective

<p><a name='3-140' href='?#3-140'>&nbsp;</a>17. <b>Photthabba</b> - owing to its subtlety, the element of cohesion <i>
(āpo)</i>
cannot be felt by the sense of touch. Only the other three Fundamental Elements 
are regarded as tangible. In water, for instance, the cold felt is <i>tejo,</i> 
the softness is <i>pathavi,</i> and the pressure is <i>vāyo.</i> One cannot 
touch <i>āpo</i> as its property is cohesion. </p>

rūpa.</i> In the Atthasālini <i>hadayavatthu</i> is explained as <i>cittassa 
vatthu</i> (basis of consciousness). </p>

<p><a name='3-146' href='?#3-146'>&nbsp;</a>It is clear that the Buddha did not definitely assign a specific seat for 
consciousness, as He has done with the other senses. It was the cardiac theory 
(the view that heart is the seat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, 
and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have 
accepted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Patthāna, 
the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such 
indirect terms as <i>&quot;yam rūpam nissāya&#39;&#39;</i>
&quot;depending on that material thing&quot;, without positively asserting whether that <i>
rūpa</i>
was either the heart <i>(hadaya)</i> or the brain. But, according to the views 
of commentators like Venerable Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha, the seat of 
consciousness is definitely the heart. It should be understood that the Buddha 
has neither accepted nor rejected this ancient popular cardiac theory. </p>

Psychic life, which is one of the fifty-two mental states <i>(cetasikās),</i> 
and physical life, which is one of the twenty-eight <i>rūpas,</i> are essential 
characteristics of this so-called being. Psychic life is one of the seven 
universals and physical life is associated with almost every material group 
except in dead matter. Simultaneous with the arising of the 
rebirth-consciousness, physical life also springs up together with the initial 
material groups. <i>Jīvita</i> is qualified by <i>indriya</i>
because it has a dominating influence over other co-adjuncts in vivifying them. </p>

<p><a name='3-165' href='?#3-165'>&nbsp;</a>28. <b>ākāsadhātu</b> - Ceylon Commentators derive <i>ākāsa</i>
from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> kas,</i> to plough. Since there is no 
ploughing as on earth, space is called <i>ākāsa</i>. According to Sanskrit, <i>
ākāsa</i> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> kās, </i>to view, 
to recognize. In Ledi Sayadaw&#39;s opinion it is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> kās, </i>to shine, to appear. <i>ākāsa</i> is space which in itself is 
nothingness. As such it is eternal. <i>ākāsa</i> is a dhātu in the sense of a 
non-entity <i>(nijjīva),</i> not as an existing element like the four 
Essentials. By <i>ākāsa,</i> as one of the 28 <i>rūpas,</i>
is meant not so much the outside space as the intra-atomic space that &#39;limits&#39; 
or separates material groups <i>(rūpakalāpas).</i> Hence in Abhidhamma it is 
regarded as a <i>&#39;pariccheda-rūpa&#39;.</i>
Although <i>ākāsa</i> is not an objective reality, as it is invariably 
associated with all material units that arise in four ways, Abhidhamma teaches 
that it, too, is produced by the same four causes such as Kamma, mind, seasonal 
changes. and food. Simultaneous with the arising and perishing of the 
conditioned <i>rūpas, ākāsa rūpa</i> also arises and perishes. </p>

another and one understands another&#39;s intentions. It is done both by action and 
speech - <i>kāya-viññatti</i> and <i>vacī-viññatti.</i> The former is caused by 
the &#39;air-element&#39; <i>(vāyo-dhātu) </i>produced by mind <i>(cittaja);</i> the

The subsequent arising of the three decads from the static stage of

qualities; but it is the sensitive eye <i>(cakkhupasādarūpa) </i>that controls 
the remaining nine. The remaining <i>pasādarūpas</i> should be similarly

regarded as objects that do not approach the eye and ear respectively as in the 
case of bodily contacts, etc. Both eye and ear cognize distant objects without 
any direct approach. In the case of other objects they directly contact the 
sense-organs. For instance, taste must directly touch the tongue. So are the 
other two objects. This may be the reason, irrespective of the wave theory, why 
the author distinguishes between senses that reach, and do not reach, the 
objects. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><a name='3-307' href='?#3-307'>&nbsp;</a>52. <b>Rhūpasamutthana</b> - Buddhism does not attempt to solve the problem 
of the ultimate origin of matter. It takes for granted that matter exists and 
states that <i>rūpa</i> develops in four ways. </p>

<p><a name='3-308' href='?#3-308'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-309' href='?#3-309'>&nbsp;</a>53. <b>Kammaja</b> - Strictly speaking, by Kamma are meant past moral and 
immoral types of consciousness. It is only those classes of consciousness 
pertaining to the <i>kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i>-spheres that tend to produce <i>
rūpa.</i> They are 12 types of immoral consciousness, 8 types of moral 
consciousness, and the 5 moral <i>rūpa jhānas.</i> A moral or immoral 
birth-reproductive Kamma generated at the dying moment of a person, conditions 
the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta)</i> in a subsequent birth. 
Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth-consciousness, <i>rūpas</i>
conditioned by past Kamma spring up at every instant, like the flame of a lamp, 
up to the 17th thought-moment reckoned from the dying moment of the person. </p>

<p><a name='3-310' href='?#3-310'>&nbsp;</a>At the very moment of conception there arise, as a result of the reproductive 
Karmic force, three <i>dasakas</i> or &#39;decads&#39; - namely, the <i>kāya, bhāva,</i> 
and <i>vatthu</i> - body, sex, and base decads. The body decad is composed of 
the four elements, four derivatives, vitality and the <i>kāyapasāda.</i> The 
sex-decad and the base-decad are similarly constituted. </p>

<p><a name='3-311' href='?#3-311'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-312' href='?#3-312'>&nbsp;</a>54. <b>Cittaja</b> - Mind, the invisible but more powerful composite factor 
of the so-called being, has the potentiality to produce <i>rūpa.</i> In other 
words, good and bad thoughts produce desirable and undesirable material 
phenomena. This is apparent from the physical changes that result from thoughts 
generated by a person. According to Abhidhamma, it is from the arising moment of 
the first <i>bhavanga,</i> that is, immediately after the rebirth-consciousness, 
that material phenomena arising from mind spring up. The rebirth-consciousness 
does not produce mind-born <i>rūpas,</i> since Kamma does that function, and 
since it is a newcomer to the fresh existence. No mind-born <i>rūpas</i>
arise at the static and perishing thought-moments, as they are weak. The ten 
sense-cognitives lack the potentiality to produce <i>rūpa.</i> The four <i>arūpa 
vipāka</i>
<i>jhānas</i> do not produce <i>rūpa,</i> as they are developed through 
non-attachment to <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p><a name='3-313' href='?#3-313'>&nbsp;</a>It is stated that <i>jhāna</i> factors are essential to produce mind-born <i>
rūpa.</i> One who possesses <i>jhānas</i> can therefore produce powerful <i>
rūpas</i>
which would enable him to live even without edible food. The mentally alert do 
not lack vitality. One who experiences Nibbānic bliss could live without any 
food for a considerable period. For instance, the Buddha fasted 49 days 
immediately after His Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='3-314' href='?#3-314'>&nbsp;</a>Of the 75 types of consciousness, 26 <i>javanas</i> (10 <i>rūpa kusala</i>
and <i>kriyā,</i> 8 <i>arūpa kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> and 8 <i>lokuttaras)</i> 
could produce abnormal bodily movements such as passing through the air, diving 
into the earth, walking on water, etc. </p>

<p><a name='3-315' href='?#3-315'>&nbsp;</a>Here the Determining consciousness is the mind-door consciousness <i>

<p><a name='3-319' href='?#3-319'>&nbsp;</a>55. <b>Utuja</b> - It was stated earlier that Kamma produces, at the moment 
of rebirth, three decads <i>kāya, bhāva,</i> and <i>vatthu.</i> The internal <i>
tejo</i>
element, found in these three groups, combined with the external <i>tejo</i> 
element, produces material phenomena caused by seasonal conditions at the static 
stage of the rebirth-consciousness. At the genetic stage Kamma-born <i>tejo</i> 
element takes the place of mind-born <i>tejo</i> element. </p>

<p><a name='3-320' href='?#3-320'>&nbsp;</a>It is clear that the term <i>utu</i> has been used in the sense of <i>tejo</i>
which constitutes both heat and cold. Strictly speaking, it is the internal and

physical food and the sap <i>(ojā)</i> contained in the material groups born of 
Kamma, mind, and seasonal conditions. The internal <i>ojā,</i> supported by the 
external nutritive essence, produces <i>rūpa</i> at the static stage which 
endures for 49 minor thought-instants. <i>Rūpas</i> arise when the <i>ojā</i> 
diffuses the body. Internal sap is alone incapable of producing <i>rūpa</i> 
without the aid of external nutritive essence. </p>

<p><a name='3-388' href='?#3-388'>&nbsp;</a>Arising of Material Phenomena (58)</b></font></p>

<p><a name='3-389' href='?#3-389'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-390' href='?#3-390'>&nbsp;</a>§ 6. All these material qualities are obtained, with no deficiency, according 
to circumstances, during lifetime in the <i>kāma</i>-sphere. But at conception, 
to moisture-born beings and to those of spontaneous birth, there arise at most 
the seven decads - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, sex and base. As a minimum 
sometimes, eye, ear, nose, and sex decads are not obtained. This is how 
deficiencies of material groups should be understood. </p>

<p><a name='3-391' href='?#3-391'>&nbsp;</a>To the womb-born creatures there arise three decads - body, sex and base. 
Sometimes, however, the sex-decad is not obtained. From the conception and 
thereafter, during lifetime, gradually there arise eye-decads and so forth. </p>

<p><a name='3-392' href='?#3-392'>&nbsp;</a>Thus the continuity of material groups produced in four ways - namely, 
Kamma-born from the time of conception, mind-born from the second moment of 
consciousness, season-born from the time of the static stage, food-born from the 
time of the diffusion of nutritive essence - uninterruptedly flows on in the <i>
kāma</i>-sphere till the end of life, like the flame of a lamp, or the stream of 
a river. </p>

<p><a name='3-393' href='?#3-393'>&nbsp;</a>But at the time of death, from the seventeenth moment, reckoned backward from 
the decease-consciousness starting from the static stage of consciousness, 
kamma-born material phenomena no longer arise. Kamma-born material qualities 
that arose earlier exist till the decease-moment and then cease. Following that, 
the consciousness-born and nutriment-born material phenomena come to cessation. 
Thereafter a continuity of material qualities produced by physical changes 
persists while what is called a corpse lasts. </p>

<p><a name='3-394' href='?#3-394'>&nbsp;</a>Thus to the dead persons, again in a subsequent life, material qualities 
similarly arise starting from the conception. </p>

<p><a name='3-395' href='?#3-395'>&nbsp;</a>In the <i>rūpa</i>-plane decads of nose, tongue, body, sex and the material 
groups produced by food do not arise. Therefore to them at the time of rebirth 
there arise four material groups produced by Kamma, such as the three decads of 
eye, ear, and base, and the vital nonad. During life material qualities produced 
by mind and physical changes arise. </p>

<p><a name='3-396' href='?#3-396'>&nbsp;</a>But to the mindless beings there do not arise eye, ear, base and sound. 
Similarly mind-born material qualities do not arise. Therefore at the moment of 
their rebirth only the vital nonad arises. During lifetime material qualities 
produced by physical changes, with the exception of sound, continue. </p>

<p><a name='3-397' href='?#3-397'>&nbsp;</a>Thus in the three planes of <i>kāma, rūpa</i> and <i>asañña</i>
(Mindless) the procedure of material phenomena should be understood in two ways 
as regards rebirth and lifetime. </p>

<p><a name='3-398' href='?#3-398'>&nbsp;</a>In the <i>kāma</i>-sphere are obtained 28 material qualities, 23 in the <i>
rūpa</i>-plane, 17 in the <i>asañña</i>-plane, but none in the <i>arūpa</i>-plane.
</p>

<p><a name='3-399' href='?#3-399'>&nbsp;</a>At the moment of birth, sound, mutation, decay and impermanence are not 
obtained. During lifetime there is nothing that is not obtained. </p>

<p><a name='3-404' href='?#3-404'>&nbsp;</a>§ 7. Nibbāna however is termed supramundane, and is to be realized by the 
wisdom of the Four Paths. It becomes an object to the Paths and Fruits, and is 
called Nibbāna because it is a departure <i>(ni)</i> from cord-like, <i>(vāna</i>) 
craving. </p>

<p><a name='3-405' href='?#3-405'>&nbsp;</a>Nibbāna is onefold according to its intrinsic nature. </p>

<p><a name='3-406' href='?#3-406'>&nbsp;</a>According to the way (it is experienced) it is twofold - namely, the element

<p><a name='3-408' href='?#3-408'>&nbsp;</a>Great seers who are free from craving declare that Nibbāna is an objective

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><a name='3-412' href='?#3-412'>&nbsp;</a>57. <i>Rūpas</i> do not arise singly but collectively in groups. There are 21 
such material groups. </p>

<p><a name='3-413' href='?#3-413'>&nbsp;</a>As all mental states possess four common characteristics, so <i>rūpas</i>
found in the aforesaid groups possess four salient characteristics. For 
instance, in the &#39;eye-decad&#39; all the ten associated <i>rūpas</i> arise and cease 
together <i>(ekuppāda-ekanirodha).
</i>The earth-element, which is one of the ten, acts as a basis for the 
remaining nine <i>(ekanissaya).</i>
All these ten coexist <i>(sahavutti). </i>It should be understood that the 
earth-element of the &#39;eye-decad&#39; does not serve as a basis for the associated <i>
rūpas</i> of the &#39;ear-decad&#39;. These four characteristics apply only to the 
associated <i>rūpas</i> of each particular group.</p>

<p><a name='3-414' href='?#3-414'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-415' href='?#3-415'>&nbsp;</a>58. This section deals with the manner in which these material groups come 
into being and how they exist during lifetime, at the moment of conception, and 
in different states of birth.</p>

<p><a name='3-416' href='?#3-416'>&nbsp;</a>According to Buddhism there are four kinds of birth - namely, egg-born beings <i>
(andaja),</i> womb-born beings <i>(jalābuja),</i> moisture-born beings <i>
(samsedaja),
</i>and beings having spontaneous births <i>(opapātika).</i> </p>

<p><a name='3-417' href='?#3-417'>&nbsp;</a>Embryos that take moisture as nidus for their growth, like certain lowly 
forms of animal life, belong to the third class. </p>

<p><a name='3-418' href='?#3-418'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes moisture-born beings lack certain senses and have no sex. They all 
must possess a consciousness as they are all endowed with the base-decad, that 
is, the seat of consciousness. Beings having a spontaneous birth are generally 
invisible to the physical eye. Conditioned by their past Kamma, they appear 
spontaneously, without passing through an embryonic stage. Petas and Devas 
normally, and Brahmas belong to this class.</p>

<p><a name='3-419' href='?#3-419'>&nbsp;</a>Some of those who have spontaneous birth in the <i>kāma</i>-sphere are 
asexual. But all beings who are Spontaneously born in the <i>rūpa</i>-sphere are 
not only asexual but are also devoid of sensitive nose, tongue, and body, though 
they possess those physical organs. The sensitive material qualities <i>
(pasādarūpas) </i>of those particular organs are lost as they are not of any 
practical use to Brahmas. </p>

<p><a name='3-420' href='?#3-420'>&nbsp;</a>Egg-born beings are also included among womb-born beings. At the moment of 
conception they all obtain the three decads of body, sex, and the seat of 
consciousness. At times some are devoid of both masculinity and femininity. From 
this it is seen that even eggs are constituted with a consciousness.</p>

<p><a name='3-421' href='?#3-421'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='3-422' href='?#3-422'>&nbsp;</a>59. <b>Nibbāna</b>, Sanskrit Nirvāna, is composed of <i>ni</i> and <i>vāna.</i>
<i>Ni + vāna </i>= Nivāna = Nibāna = Nibbāna. <i>Ni</i> is a particle implying 
negation. <i>Vāna</i> means weaving or craving. It is this craving which acts as 
a cord to connect the series of lives of any particular individual in the course 
of his wanderings in Samsāra.</p>

<p><a name='3-423' href='?#3-423'>&nbsp;</a>As long as one is entangled by craving or attachment, one accumulates fresh 
Karmic forces which must materialize in one form or other in the eternal cycle 
of birth and death. When all forms of craving are extirpated, Karmic forces 
cease to operate, and one, in conventional terms, attains Nibbāna, escaping the 
cycle of birth and death. The Buddhist conception of Deliverance is this escape 
from the ever-recurring cycle of birth and death, and is not merely an escape 
from &#39;sin and hell&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='3-424' href='?#3-424'>&nbsp;</a>Etymologically, Nibbāna, derived from <i>ni + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
vu,</i> to weave, means non-craving or non-attachment , or &#39;departure from 
craving&#39;. Strictly speaking, Nibbāna is that Dhamma which is gained by the 
complete destruction of all forms of craving. </p>

<p><a name='3-425' href='?#3-425'>&nbsp;</a>Nibbāna is also derived from <i>ni + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
vā,</i> to blow. In that case Nibbāna means the blowing out, the extinction, or 
the annihilation of the flames of lust, hatred, and ignorance. It should be 
understood that the mere destruction of passions is not Nibbāna <i>(khayamattam 
eva na nibbānanti vattabbam). </i>It is only the means to gain Nibbāna, and is 
not an end in itself. </p>

<p><a name='3-426' href='?#3-426'>&nbsp;</a>Nibbāna is an ultimate reality <i>(vatthu-dhamma)</i> which is supramundane <i>
(lokuttara), </i>that is, beyond the world of mind and body or the five 
&#39;aggregates&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='3-427' href='?#3-427'>&nbsp;</a>Nibbāna is to be understood by intuitive knowledge and inferential knowledge <i>
(paccakkha or pativedha ñāna and anumāna or anubodha ñāna). </i>To express both 
ideas it is stated that Nibbāna is to be realized by means of the wisdom 
pertaining to the four Paths of Sainthood and that it becomes an object to the 
Paths and Fruits. </p>

<p><a name='3-428' href='?#3-428'>&nbsp;</a>Intrinsically <i>(sabhāvato)</i> Nibbāna is peaceful (santi). As such it is 
unique <i>(kevala).</i> This single Nibbāna is viewed as twofold according to 
the way it is experienced before and after death. The text uses a simple but 
recondite Pāli phrase - <i>kāranapariyāyena.</i> The Ceylon Commentary explains 
the cause for naming it as such with respect to its having or not having the 
aggregates as the remainder <i>(sa-upādisesādivasena paññāpane kāranabhūtassa 
upādisesābhāvābhāvassa lesena).</i> Adding a note on this term S. Z. Aung 
writes: &quot;The Ceylon Commentaries explain it by <i>paññāpane kāranassa lesena</i> 
- by way of device of the means (of knowing) in the matter of language.&quot; -

by craving and false views. It also signifies passions <i>(kilesas). </i>
According to the text and the Commentarial interpretations, Nibbāna, experienced 
by Sotāpannas, Sakadāgāmis, and Anāgāmis, is <i>saupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i> as 
they have the body and some passions still remaining. Nibbāna of the Arahats is 
also <i>saupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i>
as they have the body still remaining. It is only the Nibbāna of the Arahats 
after their death that is termed <i>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i> because the 
aggregates and the passions are discarded by them. </p>

Nibbāna comprehended by Arahats. It states: </p>

<p><a name='4-78' href='?#4-78'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-79' href='?#4-79'>&nbsp;</a>2. <b>āsava</b> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
su,</i> to flow. They are so called either because they flow up to the topmost 
plane of existence or because they persist as far as the <i>gotrabhū</i> 
consciousness (i.e., the thought-moment that immediately precedes the 
Path-consciousness of the &#39;Stream-winner&#39; - sotāpatti). These <i>āsavas</i> are 
latent in all worldlings and may rise to the surface in any plane of existence. 
They lie dormant in all from an indefinite period and are treated as strong 
intoxicants or drugs that infatuate beings. Defilements, Corruptions, 
Depravities, Taints, Intoxicants, Stains, are suggested as the closest 
equivalents for this &#39;infamously famous&#39; Pāli term. See Compendium p. 170, n. 1; 
p. 227. </p>

<p><a name='4-80' href='?#4-80'>&nbsp;</a>Of the four <i>āsavas, kāmāsava</i> means attachment to sensual pleasures, <i>
bhavāsava</i> is attachment to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> planes of existence, <i>
ditthāsava</i> are the sixty-two kinds of erroneous views, (see Digha Nikāya 1) 
and <i>avijjāsava</i> is ignorance with regard to the four Noble Truths, past 
life, future life, both past and future lives, and the Law of Dependent Arising. </p>

<p><a name='4-81' href='?#4-81'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-82' href='?#4-82'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Ogha</b> is derived from <i>ava + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
han, </i>to harm or kill. Beings caught in the current of a great flood are 
overturned and swept away directly to the sea and are hurled into the bottom. In 
the same way these <i>oghas</i>
drown beings completely and sweep them away into states of misery. </p>

<p><a name='4-83' href='?#4-83'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-84' href='?#4-84'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Yoga</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>yuj,</i>
to yoke. <i>Yogas</i> are those that yoke beings to the round of existence or to 
the machine of existence. </p>

<p><a name='4-85' href='?#4-85'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-86' href='?#4-86'>&nbsp;</a>5. <b>Ganthas</b> are those that bind mind with body or the present body with 
bodies of future existences. Here the term kāya is used in the sense of mass or 
body both mental and physical. </p>

<p><a name='4-87' href='?#4-87'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-88' href='?#4-88'>&nbsp;</a>6. <b>Upādānāni</b> is derived from <i>upa + ā <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
dā,</i> to give. Intense craving is implied by the term. Hence in the <i>
paticcasamuppāda</i>
it is stated: Because of craving <i>(tanhā)</i> there is attachment or grasping <i>
(upādāna).</i>
<i>Tanhā</i> is like a thief groping in the dark to steal some thing. Upādāna is 
like the actual stealing. </p>

<p><a name='4-89' href='?#4-89'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-90' href='?#4-90'>&nbsp;</a>7. <b>Attavādūpādāna</b> - Commentaries mention twenty kinds of soul-theories 
associated with the five Aggregates as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><a name='4-91' href='?#4-91'>&nbsp;</a>(i) Soul is identical with the body,</p>
        <p><a name='4-92' href='?#4-92'>&nbsp;</a>(ii) Soul is possessed of a body,</p>
        <p><a name='4-93' href='?#4-93'>&nbsp;</a>(iii) Soul is in the body,</p>
        <p><a name='4-94' href='?#4-94'>&nbsp;</a>(iv) Body is in the soul. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='4-95' href='?#4-95'>&nbsp;</a>Four soul-theories connected with each of the remaining four Aggregates 
should be similarly understood.</p>

<p><a name='4-96' href='?#4-96'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-97' href='?#4-97'>&nbsp;</a>8. <b>Nīvaranāni</b> - is derived from <i>nī + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
var,</i> to obstruct, to hinder. They are so called because they obstruct the 
way to celestial and Nibbānic bliss. According to the commentary this term means 
that which prevents the arising of good thoughts in the way of <i>jhānas,</i> 
etc., or that which does not allow the <i>jhānas</i> to arise, or that which 
obstructs the eye of wisdom. See A Manual of Buddhism, pp. 113-115, and The 
Buddha and His Teachings, pp. 539-542. </p>

<p><a name='4-98' href='?#4-98'>&nbsp;</a>Usually <i>nīvaranas</i> are regarded as five, excluding ignorance. </p>

<p><a name='4-99' href='?#4-99'>&nbsp;</a>Both sloth and torpor, restlessness and brooding, are grouped together 
because their functions <i>(kicca),</i> causes <i>(āhāra = hetu),</i> and their 
opposing factors are similar. The function of sloth and torpor is mental 
inactivity; that of restlessness and brooding is disquietude. The cause of the 
first pair is laziness; that of the second pair is vexation about the loss of 
relatives, etc. Energy is opposed to the first pair; tranquillity, to the second 
pair. </p>

<p><a name='4-100' href='?#4-100'>&nbsp;</a>Sense-desire is compared to water mixed with various colours; ill will, to 
boiling water; sloth and torpor, to water covered with moss; restlessness and 
brooding, to perturbed water caused by wind; indecision, to turbid and muddy 
water. </p>

<p><a name='4-101' href='?#4-101'>&nbsp;</a>Just as one cannot perceive one&#39;s own reflection in muddy water, even so when 
one is obsessed by Hindrances one cannot perceive what is conducive to the good 
and happiness of oneself and others. </p>

<p><a name='4-102' href='?#4-102'>&nbsp;</a>These Hindrances are temporarily inhibited by the jhānas. They are completely 
eradicated by attaining, the four stages of Sainthood. Doubt or indecision is 
eradicated by attaining <i>sotāpatti;</i> sense-desire, ill will and brooding, 
by attaining Anāgāmi; sloth, torpor, and restlessness by Arahatta. </p>

<p><a name='4-103' href='?#4-103'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-104' href='?#4-104'>&nbsp;</a>9. <b>Anusaya,</b> derived from <i>anu + si, </i>to lie, to sleep, are those 
that lie dormant in oneself until an opportune moment arises for them to come to 
the surface as they have not been eradicated. All passions are <i>anusayas;</i> 
but these seven are the strongest. Every worldling who has reached the topmost <i>
jhāna</i> plane, when born amongst mankind, may give vent to these evil 
tendencies as they are latent in him. </p>

<p><a name='4-105' href='?#4-105'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-106' href='?#4-106'>&nbsp;</a>10. <b>Samyojana</b> - from <i>sam + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> yuj,</i>
to yoke, to bind, are those which bind beings to the round of existence. By 
means of the four Paths <i>(magga)</i> they are eradicated by degrees. See Ch. 
1. </p>

<p><a name='4-107' href='?#4-107'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-108' href='?#4-108'>&nbsp;</a>11. <b>Kilesas</b> are those which defile or torment the mind. </p>

<p><a name='4-109' href='?#4-109'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-110' href='?#4-110'>&nbsp;</a>12. In the categories of evil the term <i>kāma</i> is at times applied to <i>
kāma</i>-sphere, and <i>bhava</i> to both <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> spheres. <i>
Lobha</i>
is implied by both <i>kāma-tanhā</i> and <i>bhava-tanhā.</i> Attachment to <i>
rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i>-spheres is <i>bhava-tanhā</i>. The three terms - <i>
sīlabbataparāmāsa</i>
(indulgence in rites and ceremonies), <i>idamsaccābhinivesa</i> (the dogmatic 
belief that this alone is truth) and <i>attavādūpādāna</i> (soul-theory) - 
connote <i>ditthi</i>
(false view, or error). Both <i>kāmāsava</i> and <i>bhavāsava</i> connote <i>
lobha.</i>
Strictly speaking, there are only three <i>āsavas, oghas, yogas,</i> and <i>
ganthas.</i>
Similarly there are only two <i>upādānas</i> by way of <i>lobha</i> and <i>
ditthi.</i> </p>

<p><a name='4-111' href='?#4-111'>&nbsp;</a>When the two pairs - <i>thīna-middha</i> and <i>uddhacca-kukkucca</i>
- are treated as four mental states, <i>nīvaranas</i> amount to eight. When <i>
kāmarāga</i>
and <i>bhavarāga</i> are grouped in craving, <i>anusayas</i> amount to six. The 
ten <i>samyojanas</i>, according to Suttanta, are reduced to seven when <i>
kāmarāga, rūparāga, arūparāga</i>
are included in <i>lobha,</i> and <i>ditthi</i> and <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa</i> in <i>
ditthi.</i>
The ten <i>samyojanas</i> are treated as eight when <i>kāmarāga</i> and <i>
bhavarāga</i>
are included in <i>lobha,</i> and <i>ditthi</i> and <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa</i> in <i>
ditthi. Kilesas</i> are precisely ten. Thus, it will be seen, that the 14 
immoral mental states appear in different proportions in the nine categories of 
evil. <i>Lobha</i> is common to all. </p>

<p><a name='4-211' href='?#4-211'>&nbsp;</a>Now, amongst the Faculties, the thought, &#39;I will realize the unknown&#39; means 
the knowledge of the Path of the Stream-Winner <i>(Sotāpanna).</i> The Faculty

Highest Realization means the intermediate six kinds of knowledge. The 
controlling Faculty of vitality is twofold, physical and mental. </p>

one-pointedness does not attain to the state of a &#39;Path Constituent&#39;, 
&#39;Controlling Faculty&#39; or a &#39;Force&#39;. Only one &#39;Dominating Power&#39; (26) is obtained

<p><a name='4-222' href='?#4-222'>&nbsp;</a>13. <b>Missakasangaho</b> - This is so called because moral <i>(kusala),</i>
immoral <i>(akusala),</i> and indeterminate <i>(avyākata),</i> are mixed in this 
section.</p>

<p><a name='4-226' href='?#4-226'>&nbsp;</a>15. <b>Jhānanga</b> - <i>Jhāna</i> is explained as that which burns up the 
opposing conditions of Hindrances, or that which closely perceives the object. 
Both these meanings are applicable to the ecstasies, gained by mental 
concentration. The six constituents of <i>jhāna</i> are used in these two 
senses. When the same factors appear in a moral or immoral consciousness and 
&#39;displeasure&#39; appears in an immoral consciousness, they are termed <i>jhānangas</i> 
in the second general sense. Only displeasure is immoral; the rest are moral, 
immoral, and indeterminate. See Chapter 1. </p>

<p><a name='4-227' href='?#4-227'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-228' href='?#4-228'>&nbsp;</a>16. <b>Maggangāni</b> - Here <i>magga</i> is used in its general sense 
namely, that which leads to the presence of blissful states, woeful states, and 
Nibbāna <i>(sugati-duggatīnam nibbānassa ca abhimukham pāpanato maggā </i>- 
Comm.). Of the twelve constituents the last four lead to woeful states; the 
rest, to the blissful states and Nibbāna.</p>

<p><a name='4-229' href='?#4-229'>&nbsp;</a>Strictly speaking, by these twelve constituents are meant nine mental states 
found in different types of consciousness. Of the four evil constituents, wrong 
views mean the immoral <i>ditthi cetasikā;</i> wrong thoughts, wrong effort, and 
wrong one-pointedness mean the <i>vitakka, vāyāma,</i> and <i>ekaggatā cetasikās</i>
respectively found in the immoral types of consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='4-230' href='?#4-230'>&nbsp;</a>Right Understanding means the <i>paññā cetasika;</i> right thoughts, right 
effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness mean the <i>vitakka, 
vāyāma, sati</i> and <i>ekaggatā cetasikas</i> respectively, found in the moral 
and indeterminate types of consciousness. Right speech, right action, and right 
livelihood are the three Abstinences <i>(virati) </i>found collectively in the 
supramundane consciousness and separately in mundane moral types of 
consciousness. The first eight are collectively found only in the eight types of 
supramundane consciousness. By the noble Eightfold Path are meant these eight 
specific mental states. </p>

<p><a name='4-231' href='?#4-231'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-232' href='?#4-232'>&nbsp;</a>17. <b>Indriya</b> - So called because they possess a controlling power in 
their respective spheres. The first five are the sensitive organs described 
earlier. The sixth and seventh are collectively called <i>bhāvindriya.</i> 
Vitality is both physical and mental. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 represent five 
kinds of feeling. 15,16,17,18, and 19 are treated both as Faculties and Powers 
as they influence their co-adjuncts and as they overcome their opposing forces. 
The last three Faculties are very important and they pertain to the 
supramundane. By <i>anaññātam</i> is meant the Nibbāna never seen before. It is 
at the first stage of Sainthood <i>(sotāpatti)</i> that the four Truths are 
realized for the first time. Hence the knowledge of the <i>sotāpatti</i> Path is 
technically called <i>anaññātam ñassāmi&#39;t&#39;</i> <i>indriyam</i>. The intermediate 
six kinds of knowledge from the <i>sotāpatti</i> Fruit to the Arahatta Path are 
termed <i>aññā</i>
(derived from <i>ā</i> = perfect + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i> to 
know), highest knowledge. As the wisdom found in all these seven types of 
supramundane consciousness controls the coexisting 37 Factors of Enlightenment, 
it is termed <i>indriya.</i>
An Arahat is called an <i>aññātāvī</i> because he has fully realized the four 
Noble Truths. The last Faculty refers to the highest knowledge of the Arahat in 
the Fruit stage.

<p><a name='4-234' href='?#4-234'>&nbsp;</a>18. <b>Balāni</b> - These nine Powers are so called because they cannot be 
shaken by the opposing forces and because they strengthen their co-adjuncts. The 
first seven are moral; the last two, immoral. The first seven, in order, are 
opposed to faithlessness, laziness, heedlessness, restlessness, ignorance, moral 
shamelessness, and moral fearlessness. The last two immoral Powers are found 
only in the immoral twelve types of consciousness and they consolidate their 
co-adjuncts. </p>

<p><a name='4-236' href='?#4-236'>&nbsp;</a>19. <b>Adhipati,</b> lit., supremacy, or lordship therein. The difference 
between <i>adhipati</i> and <i>indriya</i> should be clearly understood. <i>
Adhipati</i>
may be compared to a king who, as the sole head of the State, lords over all his 
ministers. <i>Indriyas</i> are compared to the king&#39;s ministers who control only 
their respective departments without interfering with the others. The Faculty of 
eye, for instance, controls only its coexisting <i>rūpas</i> without any 
interference with the controlling faculty of the ear. In the case of <i>
adhipati,</i> one dominates all the other coexisting factors with no resistance 
from any. No two <i>adhipatis</i> can exercise supreme authority simultaneously. <i>
Indriyas</i> can have their compeers. </p>

<p><a name='4-237' href='?#4-237'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-238' href='?#4-238'>&nbsp;</a>20. Here <i>citta</i> refers to the <i>javana</i> thought-process and <i>
vimamsā</i>
to the faculty of wisdom <i>(paññindriya). </i></p>

<p><a name='4-239' href='?#4-239'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-240' href='?#4-240'>&nbsp;</a>21. <b>āhāra,</b> in this connection, is used in the sense of sustenance. 
Edible food <i>(kabalīkārāhāra)</i> sustains the material body. <i>Phassāhāra</i>
or contact or sense-impact sustains the five kinds of feeling. By <i>
manosamcetanāhāra</i>
are meant the different kinds of volitions present in the 29 types of moral and 
immoral mundane consciousness. They sustain or produce rebirth in the three 
spheres. <i>Viññānāhāra</i>
signifies the rebirth-consciousness that sustains the mental states and material 
phenomena
<i>(nāma-rūpa)</i> which arise simultaneously. There are 19 such types of 
rebirth-consciousness. In the case of Mindless Spheres they sustain only <i>
rūpa;</i> in the case of Formless Spheres they sustain only nāma. In the 
existences where the five Aggregates are present they sustain both mind and 
matter. </p>

<p><a name='4-241' href='?#4-241'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-242' href='?#4-242'>&nbsp;</a>22. No <i>jhāna</i> constituents are present in the 10 types of 
sense-cognitions because the sense-impressions are weak, and close perception of 
the object is absent.</p>

<p><a name='4-243' href='?#4-243'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-244' href='?#4-244'>&nbsp;</a>23. Effortless states are the sixteen types of consciousness, namely, ten 
sense-cognitions, two <i>sampaticchanas</i>, three <i>santīranas</i>, and the 
sense-door consciousness <i>(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i> One-pointedness present in 
them is not very strong. </p>

<p><a name='4-245' href='?#4-245'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-246' href='?#4-246'>&nbsp;</a>24. The Rootless are the 18 <i>ahetuka-cittas.</i> </p>

<p><a name='4-247' href='?#4-247'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-248' href='?#4-248'>&nbsp;</a>25. The one pointedness present in the <i>vicikicchā-citta</i> serves only to 
stabilize the mind. It is not powerful. </p>

<p><a name='4-249' href='?#4-249'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-250' href='?#4-250'>&nbsp;</a>26. There are no <i>adhipatis</i> in the <i>ahetuka</i> and <i>ekahetuka 
cittas.</i> </p>

<p><a name='4-251' href='?#4-251'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-252' href='?#4-252'>&nbsp;</a>27. Strictly speaking, there are five <i>jhāna</i> constituents because the 
three kinds of feeling could be treated as one; path constituents are nine, 
since wrong thoughts, effort, and one-pointedness are included in <i>vitakka, 
viriya</i>
and <i>ekaggatā</i> respectively. <i>Indriyas</i> are sixteen when the five 
kinds of feelings are grouped in one, and the three supramundane in <i>paññā. </i></p>

<p><a name='4-291' href='?#4-291'>&nbsp;</a>Here by the four Foundations of Mindfulness, Right Mindfulness alone is 
implied. Right Effort is implied by the four Supreme Efforts. </p>

fourteen according to their nature: Will, Thought, Equanimity, Confidence, 
Quietude, Rapture, Right Understanding, Aspirations or Thoughts, Effort, the 
three Abstinences, Right Mindfulness, and Concentration. </p>

<p><a name='4-293' href='?#4-293'>&nbsp;</a>The enumeration of these 37 sublime factors is as follows: Aspirations, 
Quietude, Rapture, Equanimity, Will, Thought, the three Abstinences, occur once;

five times; Confidence twice (35). </p>

<p><a name='4-294' href='?#4-294'>&nbsp;</a>All these, save at times Aspirations and Rapture, occur in the Supramundane

<p><a name='4-298' href='?#4-298'>&nbsp;</a>28. <b>Bodhipakkhiya</b> - Bodhi means Enlightenment or the aspirant for 
Enlightenment. <i>Pakkhiya,</i> literally, means &#39;on the side of&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='4-299' href='?#4-299'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-300' href='?#4-300'>&nbsp;</a>29. <b>Satipatthāna</b> - <i>sati</i> = mindfulness, awareness, or 
attentiveness; <i>patthāna</i> = establishment, application, foundations, bases. 
These <i>satipatthānas</i>
are intended to develop both concentration and insight. Each <i>satipatthāna</i> 
serves a specific purpose. Contemplation on these four leads, on the one hand, 
to the development of &#39;undesirableness&#39; <i>(asubha),</i> painfulness <i>
(dukkha),</i> impermanence <i>(anicca),</i>
and &#39;soullessness&#39; <i>(anattā); </i>and, on the other hand, to the eradication 
of &#39;desirableness&#39;, pleasure, permanence and substantiality. </p>

<p><a name='4-301' href='?#4-301'>&nbsp;</a>Briefly, the objects of mindfulness may be divided into <i>nāma</i>
and <i>rūpa.</i> The first - which deals with <i>rūpa,</i> breath is also 
regarded as a kind of <i>rūpa.</i> The second and the third deal with different 
kinds of feelings and thoughts. The fourth deals with both <i>nāma</i> and <i>
rūpa.</i> Hence it is very difficult to render the Pāli term, Dhamma, used in 
this connection, by one English equivalent. It is preferable to retain the Pāli 
term to avoid any misunderstanding. </p>

<p><a name='4-306' href='?#4-306'>&nbsp;</a>31. <b>Iddhipāda</b> - The means of accomplishing one&#39;s own end or purpose. 
Strictly speaking, all these four pertain to the Supramundane Consciousness. <i>
Chanda</i>
is the mental state &#39;wish-to-do&#39;. <i>Viriya</i> refers to the four Supreme 
Efforts. <i>Citta</i>
means the Supramundane Consciousness. <i>Vīmamsā</i> signifies the mental state 
of wisdom present in the Supramundane Consciousness. Only when these four are 
present in the Supramundane Consciousness are they termed <i>iddhipāda.</i> </p>

means seeing mind and matter as they truly are. It is insight. By <i>passaddhi</i> 
are meant both <i>citta-passaddhi</i> and <i>kāya-passaddhi</i> mental states. <i>
Upekkhā</i>
does not mean hedonic indifference but mental equipoise known as <i>
tatramajjhattatā.</i>
<i>Dhammavicaya, viriya,</i> and <i>pīti</i> are opposed to <i>thīna-middha</i> 
(sloth and torpor); <i>passaddhi, samādhi,</i> and <i>upekkhā,</i> to <i>
uddhacca</i>
(restlessness). </p>

Abhidhamma, it is the mental state of wisdom <i>(paññā)</i> that tends to 
eradicate ignorance <i>(avijjā).</i> It is placed first because all actions

<p><a name='4-408' href='?#4-408'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Khandha</b> means group, mass, aggregate. The Buddha analyses the 
so-called being into five groups. All the past, present, and future material 
phenomena are collectively called <i>rūpakkhandha.</i> The other four divisions 
should be similarly understood. </p>

<p><a name='4-409' href='?#4-409'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-410' href='?#4-410'>&nbsp;</a>38. Here the term <b>Sankhāra</b> is used in a specific sense. Of the 52 
mental states, feeling is one, and perception is another. The remaining 50 
mental states are collectively called <i>sankhāra.</i> Mental formations, 
propensities, tendencies, syntheses, do not exactly convey the meaning of the 
Pāli term. Even &#39;volitional activities&#39; is not very appropriate. </p>

<p><a name='4-411' href='?#4-411'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;Mental states&#39; is too general, but is not misleading.</p>

<p><a name='4-413' href='?#4-413'>&nbsp;</a>39. <b>Upādānakkhandha.</b> They are so called because they form the objects 
of clinging or grasping. The eight supramundane states of consciousness and 
mental states found therein, and the ten material qualities not born of Kamma. 
are not treated as
<i>upādānakkhandha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='4-414' href='?#4-414'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-415' href='?#4-415'>&nbsp;</a>40. <b>āyatana</b> means a field, sphere, basis. </p>

<p><a name='4-417' href='?#4-417'>&nbsp;</a>41.<b>Cakkhāyatana</b> means the sensitive part of the eye which responds to

<p><a name='4-418' href='?#4-418'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-419' href='?#4-419'>&nbsp;</a>42. <b>Manāyatana</b> - There is no special organ for the mind like the 
physical organs. By mind-sphere is meant the &#39;adverting consciousness&#39; <i>
(manodvārāvajjana)</i>
together with the preceding &#39;arrest <i>bhavanga&#39;</i> <i>(bhavangupaccheda).</i>

<p><a name='4-423' href='?#4-423'>&nbsp;</a>44. <b>Dhamma-dhātu</b> is synonymous with <i>dhammāyatana</i> but differs 
from <i>dhammārammana</i> as it does not include <i>citta</i> (consciousness), <i>
paññatti</i>
(concepts), and <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> (sensitive material phenomena). </p>

<p><a name='4-424' href='?#4-424'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-425' href='?#4-425'>&nbsp;</a>45. <b>Manoviññānadhātu</b> - Of the 89 classes of consciousness 76 types of 
consciousness are regarded as mind-consciousness, excluding the tenfold 
sense-consciousness <i>(dvipañcaviññāna)</i> and the three <i>manodhātu</i> (= 
two types of receiving-consciousness and sense-door consciousness). </p>

<p><a name='4-426' href='?#4-426'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='4-427' href='?#4-427'>&nbsp;</a>46. <b>Ariyasacca</b> - The Pāli term for truth is <i>sacca</i> which means 
that which is. Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>satya</i> which denotes an 
incontrovertible fact. The Buddha enunciates four such truths which are 
associated with so-called beings. They are called <i>ariyasaccānī</i> because 
they were discovered by the Greatest Ariya, the Buddha, who was far removed from 
passions . </p>

<p><a name='4-428' href='?#4-428'>&nbsp;</a>The first truth deals with <i>dukkha</i> which, for need of a better English 
equivalent, is inappropriately rendered by suffering or sorrow. As a feeling <i>
dukkha</i>
means that which is difficult to endure. As an abstract truth <i>dukkha</i> is 
used in the sense of contemptible <i>(du) </i>emptiness <i>(kha). </i>The world 
rests on suffering - hence it is contemptible. It is devoid of any reality - 
hence it is empty or void. <i>Dukkha,</i>
therefore, means contemptible void. </p>

<p><a name='4-429' href='?#4-429'>&nbsp;</a>The cause of this suffering is craving or attachment <i>(tanhā)</i>
which leads to repeated births. The third Noble Truth is Nibbāna which can be 
achieved in this life itself by the total eradication of all forms of craving. 
The fourth Truth is the Noble Eightfold Path or the Middle Way. </p>

<p><a name='1-117' href='?#1-117'>&nbsp;</a>6. <b>Sankhāra</b> - This is a multisignificant term which should be 
understood according to the context. Here the term signifies immoral <i>
(akusala), </i>moral
<i>(kusala),</i> and unshakable <i>(āneñjā)</i> volitions <i>(cetanā)</i> which 
constitute Kamma that produces rebirth. The first embraces all volitions in the 
12 types of immoral consciousness; the second, all volitions in the 8 types of 
Beautiful <i>(kusala)</i>
consciousness and the 5 types of <i>kusala rūpa-jhāna</i> consciousness; the 
third, all volitions in the 4 types of <i>kusala arūpa-jhānas.</i> Where is no 
proper English equivalent which gives the exact connotation of this Pāli term. <i>
Sankhārā,</i> as one of the five aggregates, implies the 50 mental states 
excluding feeling and perception. </p>

<p><a name='1-118' href='?#1-118'>&nbsp;</a>The volitions of the four supramundane Path consciousnesses <i>
(lokuttara-magga-citta)</i>
are not regarded as <i>sankhārā</i> because they tend to eradicate ignorance. 
Wisdom <i>(paññā)</i>
is predominant in Supramundane types of consciousness, while volition <i>
(cetanā)</i> is predominant in the mundane types of consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='1-119' href='?#1-119'>&nbsp;</a>Ignorance is predominant in immoral activities, while it is latent in moral 
activities. Hence both moral and immoral actions are regarded as caused by 
ignorance. </p>

implied by the term. </p>

<p><a name='1-122' href='?#1-122'>&nbsp;</a>The foetus in the mother&#39;s womb is formed by the combination of this

<p><a name='1-123' href='?#1-123'>&nbsp;</a>This relinking-consciousness is regarded as &quot;radiant&quot; <i>(pabhassara)</i>
as it is either devoid of immoral roots of lust, hatred and delusion (as in the 
case of rootless resultants - <i>ahetuka-vipāka),</i> or accompanied by moral 
roots (as in the case of resultants with roots).</p>

planes there arises only mind; in the case of mindless <i>(asañña)</i> planes, 
only matter; in the case of <i>kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i> planes, both mind and 
matter. </p>

bhāva-vatthu</i>

kamma. The second and third factors pertain to the past and present. The third

<p><a name='1-144' href='?#1-144'>&nbsp;</a>There are six kinds of craving corresponding to the six sense-objects such as 
form, sound, and so on. They become 12 when they are treated as internal and

consideration. When multiplied by the foregoing three kinds of craving they 
amount to 108.

<p><a name='1-271' href='?#1-271'>&nbsp;</a>18. <b>Hetu-paccaya</b> - Here <i>paccaya</i> presents some difficulty. It is 
defined as that by means of which an effect comes to be. In other words it is 
the cause. Furthermore, it is explained as a &#39;serviceable or supportive factor&#39; <i>
(upakārako dhammo).</i> <i>Hetu</i> is defined as &#39;that by which an effect is 
established&#39;. It is used in the sense of &#39;root&#39; <i>(mūlatthena).</i> Like the 
roots of a tree are hetu; like water and manure that aid its growth are <i>
paccaya.</i> In the Abhidhamma these two related terms are used in two different 
senses. In the Suttas, however, they are invariably employed as Synonymous 
terms, without any distinction, as, for example <i>ko hetu, ko paccayo</i> - 
what is the reason? what is the cause? </p>

<p><a name='1-272' href='?#1-272'>&nbsp;</a>In the Patthāna 24 such <i>paccayas</i> are enumerated, and <i>hetu</i>
is one of them. <i>Hetu-paccaya</i> is explained as <i>&#39;hetu</i> itself is a <i>
paccaya&#39;</i>
or &#39;as <i>hetu</i> it becomes a <i>paccaya&#39;</i>. It is interpreted as a 
supportive or serviceable factor in the sense of root <i>(mūlatthena upakārako 
dhammo). </i>The causal relation by way of &#39;root&#39; may be suggested as the 
closest rendering. (See Compendium, p. 279; Journal of the Pāli Text Society, 
1915-1916, pp. 29-53.) </p>

<p><a name='1-273' href='?#1-273'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;Roots are purely mental. They are the six moral and immoral roots. See 
Chapter 1. </p>

<p><a name='1-275' href='?#1-275'>&nbsp;</a>19. <b>ārammana</b> - or <b>ālambana</b>. The former is derived from <i>a + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> ram,</i> to delight in; the latter from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> 
lamb, </i>to hang upon. Things which the subject delights in or hangs upon are 
&#39;objects&#39;. There are six classes of objects. A form, for instance, acts as a 
causal relation to visual-consciousness by way of an &#39;object&#39;. It should be 
stated that there is nothing mundane or supramundane that does not become an 
object for mind. </p>

<p><a name='1-277' href='?#1-277'>&nbsp;</a>20. <b>Adhipati</b> - Lit., mastery or lordship over one&#39;s own. 0ne of the 
four dominant factors - namely, wish, thought, effort and reasoning - may, at 
one time, causally relate itself to coexistent mental states and material 
phenomena by way of predominance. &quot;Whenever such phenomena as consciousness and 
mental states arise by giving predominance to one of these four factors, then 
this phenomenon is to the other phenomenon a condition by way of predominance&quot;.

<p><a name='1-279' href='?#1-279'>&nbsp;</a>21. <b>Anantara</b> and <b>Samanantara</b> - In meaning there is no 
difference between the two terms. They differ only in etymology. According to 
Buddhist philosophy one thought-moment perishes, immediately giving birth to 
another. The succeeding thought-moment inherits all the potentialities of its 
immediate predecessor. The perishing preceding states causally relate themselves 
to immediately following states by way of contiguity and immediacy. </p>

<p><a name='1-281' href='?#1-281'>&nbsp;</a>22. <b>Sahajāta</b> - The causal relation by way of conascence, as, for 
instance, the four mental aggregates, the different mental states that 
simultaneously arise in a particular type of consciousness, the four Great 
Essentials that arise together, the appearance of the three &#39;decads&#39; at the 
moment of conception, etc. In the <i>paticca</i>-<i>samuppāda</i>
it may be mentioned that both contact and feeling which appear as causes and 
effect are conascent. </p>

<p><a name='1-282' href='?#1-282'>&nbsp;</a>A mental state may be conascent with a mental state, a mental with a 
physical, a physical with a physical, and a physical with a mental. </p>

<p><a name='1-283' href='?#1-283'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-284' href='?#1-284'>&nbsp;</a>23. <b>Aññamañña</b> - Just as the legs of a tripod are reciprocally helpful, 
even so mental or physical state or states may be causally related by way of 
reciprocity (or mutuality). Causal relations of conascence and reciprocity 
should be differentiated. They are not identical. For instance, mind-born 
material phenomena are not reciprocally related to the coexisting mind, nor are 
the material derivatives to the coexisting Great Essentials. As a rule, mind and 
matter are reciprocally related. </p>

<p><a name='1-285' href='?#1-285'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-286' href='?#1-286'>&nbsp;</a>24. <b>Nissaya</b> and <b>Upanissaya</b> - derived from <i>upa + ni + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> si,</i> to lie. <i>Upa</i> is an intensive prefix. As trees depend on 
the ground for their support, and as pictures depend on a canvas on which they 
are painted, so is the causal relation of dependence. <i>Upanissaya</i> is 
defined as a stronger form of Nissaya. It is compared to the rains on which 
depend the growth of trees. S. Z. Aung renders <i>upanissaya</i> by &#39;sufficing 
condition&#39;. For instance, one of the five heinous crimes such as matricide, 
parricide and so on, will serve as an <i>upanissaya</i>
to effect a birth in a woeful state. Good environments, early education, etc., 
will serve as a causal relation by way of &#39;dependence&#39; (nissaya) for the 
acquisition of health, wealth and knowledge in later life. Just as good actions 
become <i>upanissaya</i> for future good deeds, even so they may become <i>
upanissaya</i> for evil too as, for instance, spiritual pride. See Ledi 
Sayadaw&#39;s learned article on this subject in P.T.S. Journal, 1916, pp. 49-53. </p>

<p><a name='1-288' href='?#1-288'>&nbsp;</a>25. <b>Purejāta</b> - lit., born before or that which pre-exists. The six 
physical bases and six sensual objects are regarded as pre-existent. The 
pre-existent things are regarded as causal relations only when they continue to 
exist in the present and not by mere antecedence. Priority is not a good 
rendering. </p>

<p><a name='1-289' href='?#1-289'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-290' href='?#1-290'>&nbsp;</a>26. <b>Pacchājāta</b> - Of the 89 types of consciousness, 85 types, excluding 
the four <i>arūpa</i> resultants, and the 52 mental states, are causally related 
to the antecedent physical body by way of post-occurrence. </p>

<p><a name='1-291' href='?#1-291'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-292' href='?#1-292'>&nbsp;</a>27. <b>āsevana</b> - Repeated practice, as a rule, leads to proficiency. This 
applies to both good and evil things. By repetition one acquires a certain 
amount of skill in any particular thing. <i>āsevana</i> denotes this repeated 
practice. In <i>javana</i> process the second thought moment is causally related 
to the first, the third to the second, the fourth to the third, by way of 
recurrence. This is the reason why the fourth <i>javana</i> thought-moment is 
considered very powerful. </p>

<p><a name='1-293' href='?#1-293'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-294' href='?#1-294'>&nbsp;</a>28. <b>Kamma</b> means the volition that plays the most important part in 
moral and immoral thoughts, words, and deeds. This volition, technically known 
as Kamma, is causally related to the Kamma-born material phenomena, etc. As a 
seed to a tree so is Kamma causally related to its inevitable results. </p>

<p><a name='1-295' href='?#1-295'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-296' href='?#1-296'>&nbsp;</a>29. <b>Vipāka</b> - Like a cool breeze that pacifies a person seated under 
the cool shade of a tree, even so mental states of resultant types of 
consciousness are causally related to coexistent mental states and material 
phenomena by way of &#39;effect&#39; due to their effortless peaceful nature. </p>

<p><a name='1-297' href='?#1-297'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-298' href='?#1-298'>&nbsp;</a>30. <b>āhāra</b> - Just as material food sustains the physical body, even so 
mental foods sustain mental states. Edible food is causally related to the body 
by way of nutriment or food; so are mental contacts or impressions <i>(phassa)</i> 
to feelings; volitions or moral and immoral actions <i>(mano-sañetanā)</i> to 
rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi viññāna);</i> and rebirth-consciousness <i>
(viññāna)</i>
to mind and matter.</p>

<p><a name='1-299' href='?#1-299'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-300' href='?#1-300'>&nbsp;</a>31. <b>Indriya</b> - The controlling factors enumerated in Chapter VII become 
causally related to the coexistent mental states and material phenomena because 
they exercise control in their respective spheres. For instance, confidence 
controls its co-adjuncts in religious convictions; psychic and physical life, in 
vivifying mind and matter; mindfulness, in contemplative exercise; feelings, in 
grief and happiness, etc.</p>

<p><a name='1-301' href='?#1-301'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-302' href='?#1-302'>&nbsp;</a>32. <b>Jhāna</b> - The seven <i>jhāna</i> factors of (1) initial application, 
(2) sustained application, (3) rapture, (4) happiness, (5) equanimity, (6) 
displeasure and (7) one-pointedness are causally related to one another and 
other concomitants by way of close perception and contemplation. For instance, 
the initial application <i>(vitakka)</i> is causally related to its concomitants 
in directing them towards the desired object. See Chapter 1. </p>

<p><a name='1-303' href='?#1-303'>&nbsp;</a>1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in two classes of consciousness rooted in attachment; 
1, 2, 6, 7, in hateful consciousness; 1, 2, 5, 7, in deluded consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='1-304' href='?#1-304'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-305' href='?#1-305'>&nbsp;</a>33. <b>Magga</b> - means a way or road. One way leads to woeful states; the 
other, to states of bliss. The vehicles that convey travelers to the former are 
the evil &#39;Path Constituents&#39; of wrong views, wrong application, wrong effort, 
and wrong one-pointedness. The vehicles that ply on the latter way are right 
understanding, right aspirations, right speech, right action, right livelihood, 
right effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness. These path factors 
are causally related to both mind and body, leading downwards in the case of bad 
ones, and leading away from existence (niyyāna) in the case of good ones. </p>

<p><a name='1-306' href='?#1-306'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-307' href='?#1-307'>&nbsp;</a>34. <b>Sampayutta</b> - Though possessing distinct characteristics from an 
ultimate standpoint yet, as certain mental states arise together, perish 
together, have one identical object and one identical base, they are causally 
related to one another by way of &#39;association&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='1-308' href='?#1-308'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-309' href='?#1-309'>&nbsp;</a>35. <b>Vippayutta</b> is the opposite of the foregoing. Sweet and bitter 
tastes may be helpful to each other in being dissimilar. For instance, mind that 
depends on the heart-basis is causally related to it by way of dissociation 
because, both mind and heart-basis are not mutually bound, as water on a lotus 
leaf. </p>

<p><a name='1-310' href='?#1-310'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-311' href='?#1-311'>&nbsp;</a>36. <b>Atthi</b> is the causal relation of states that exist in the present 
to similar states like the causal relation of coexistence. The visibility of 
objects, for instance, is due to the presence of light. </p>

<p><a name='1-312' href='?#1-312'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-313' href='?#1-313'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Natthi</b> - As with the disappearance of light, darkness spreads, so 
with the disappearance of the predecessor, the successor appears. Such is the 
causal relation by way of absence. For instance, the visual consciousness <i>
(dassana)</i>
is causally related to the immediately following receiving consciousness <i>
(sampaticchana)
</i>by way of absence. </p>

<p><a name='1-314' href='?#1-314'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='1-315' href='?#1-315'>&nbsp;</a>38. <b>Vigata</b> and <b>Avigata</b> are similar to Natthi and Atthi 
respectively.</p>

<p><a name='7-79' href='?#7-79'>&nbsp;</a>How ? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name='7-80' href='?#7-80'>&nbsp;</a>A. The ten kasinas (7) are; earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, 
  white, space, and light. </p>
  <p><a name='7-81' href='?#7-81'>&nbsp;</a>B. The ten Impurities (8) are: a bloated (corpse), a discoloured (corpse), 
  a festering, (corpse), a dissected (corpse), an eaten (corpse), a 
  scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a mutilated and scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a 
  bloody (corpse), a worm-infested (corpse), and a skeleton. </p>
  <p><a name='7-82' href='?#7-82'>&nbsp;</a>C. The ten Reflections (9) are: 1. The Reflection on the Buddha, 2. The 
  Reflection on the Doctrine, 3. The Reflection on the order, 4. The Reflection 
  on morality, 5. The Reflection on generosity, 6. The Reflection on deities, 7. 
  The Reflection on peace, 8. The Reflection on death, 9. Mindfulness regarding 
  the body, 10. Mindfulness regarding breathing (10). </p>
  <p><a name='7-83' href='?#7-83'>&nbsp;</a>D. The four Illimitables, also called Sublime States, (11), are: 
  loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity. </p>
  <p><a name='7-84' href='?#7-84'>&nbsp;</a>E. The one Perception is the feeling of loathsomeness about food (12). </p>
  <p><a name='7-85' href='?#7-85'>&nbsp;</a>F. The one Analysis is the analysis of the four elements (13). </p>
  <p><a name='7-86' href='?#7-86'>&nbsp;</a>G. The four <i>arūpa-jhānas</i> are the &#39;Infinity of Space&#39; (14) and so 
  forth. In the exposition of &#39;Calm&#39; there are altogether forty (15) subjects of 
  meditation. </p>

regarding the body&#39;, such as the 32 parts, are suitable for those of a lustful 
temperament (16). </p>

<p><a name='7-92' href='?#7-92'>&nbsp;</a>The four &#39;Illimitables&#39; and the four colored <i>kasinas</i> are suitable for 
those of a hateful temperament (17). </p>

<p><a name='7-93' href='?#7-93'>&nbsp;</a>The reflection on &#39;Breathing&#39; is suitable for those of an unintelligent and 
discursive temperament.</p>

<p><a name='7-94' href='?#7-94'>&nbsp;</a>The six Reflections on the Buddha and so forth are suitable for those of a 
devout temperament; Reflection on &#39;Death&#39;, &#39;Peace&#39;, &#39;Perception&#39;, and 
&#39;Analysis&#39;, for those of an intellectual temperament, and all the remaining 
subjects of mental culture, for all. </p>

<p><a name='7-95' href='?#7-95'>&nbsp;</a>Of the <i>kasinas</i> a wide one is suitable for the unintelligent, and a 
small one for the discursive.</p>

<p><a name='7-96' href='?#7-96'>&nbsp;</a>Herein this is the section on suitability. </p>

<p><a name='7-97' href='?#7-97'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-101' href='?#7-101'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-102' href='?#7-102'>&nbsp;</a>§ 4. The preliminary stage of mental culture is attainable in all these 
forty; subjects of meditation. In the ten subjects of mental culture such as the 
eight Reflections on the Buddha and so forth and the one &#39;Perception&#39;, and the 
one &#39;Analysis&#39; (18) only proximate mental culture is attained but not the 
concentrative stage. In the thirty remaining subjects of mental culture the 
concentrative stage of mental culture is also attained. </p>

<p><a name='7-103' href='?#7-103'>&nbsp;</a>Therein the ten <i>kasinas</i> and the &#39;Breathing&#39; produce five <i>jhānas;</i>
the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness regarding the body&#39; only the first <i>
jhāna;</i>
the first three &#39;Illimitables&#39; such as loving-kindness, four <i>jhānas;</i> 
&#39;equanimity&#39; (19) the fifth <i>jhāna.</i></p>

<p><a name='7-104' href='?#7-104'>&nbsp;</a>Thus these twenty-six subjects of mental culture produce <i>rūpa-jhānas.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='7-105' href='?#7-105'>&nbsp;</a>The four &#39;formless&#39; objects produce the <i>arūpa-jhānas.</i></p>

<p><a name='7-111' href='?#7-111'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-112' href='?#7-112'>&nbsp;</a>§ 5. Of the three signs, the preliminary sign and the abstract sign are 
generally obtained in every case according to the object. But the conceptualized 
image is obtained in the <i>&#39;Kasinas&#39;</i>, &#39;Impurities&#39;, &#39;Parts of the body&#39;, 
and &#39;Breathing&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-113' href='?#7-113'>&nbsp;</a>It is by means of the conceptualized image that the proximate on pointedness 
and the ecstatic one-pointedness are developed. </p>

<p><a name='7-115' href='?#7-115'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-116' href='?#7-116'>&nbsp;</a>How? </p>

<p><a name='7-117' href='?#7-117'>&nbsp;</a>Whatever object amongst the earth kasinas and so forth, a beginner takes to 
practice meditation, is called a preliminary sign and that meditation is 
preliminary mental culture. When that sign is perceived by the mind and enters 
the mind-door as if seen by the very (physical) eye then it is called the 
abstract sign. That meditation becomes well established.</p>

<p><a name='7-118' href='?#7-118'>&nbsp;</a>Likewise when a counter-image born of mediation, freed from original defects 
(20) reckoned as a concept, is well established and fixed in the mind of one who 
is well composed and who thereafter, practices meditation on the abstract sign 
by means of preliminary concentration then it is said that the conceptualized 
image has arisen. </p>

<p><a name='7-154' href='?#7-154'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Carita</b> signifies the intrinsic nature of a person, which is 
revealed when one is in a normal state without being preoccupied with anything. 
The temperaments of people differ owing to the diversity of their actions or 
Kammas. Habitual actions tend to form particular temperaments. </p>

<p><a name='7-155' href='?#7-155'>&nbsp;</a><i>Rāga</i> (lust) is predominant in some, while <i>dosa</i> (anger, hatred 
or ill will), in others. Most people belong to these two categories. There are a 
few others who lack intelligence and are more or less ignorant <i>(moha-carita).</i> 
Akin to the ignorant are those whose minds oscillate, unable to focus their 
attention deliberately on one thing <i>(vitakka-carita).</i> By nature some are 
exceptionally devout
<i>(saddhā-carita), </i>while others are exceptionally intelligent <i>
(buddhi-carita). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-156' href='?#7-156'>&nbsp;</a>Thus, in brief, there are six kinds of temperaments.</p>

<p><a name='7-157' href='?#7-157'>&nbsp;</a>By combining them with one another, we get 63 types. With the inclusion of <i>
ditthi-carita</i> (speculative temperament) there are 64. </p>

<p><a name='7-159' href='?#7-159'>&nbsp;</a>5. The preliminary stages of mental development are termed <i>
parikamma-bhāvanā</i>. Mental culture, from the moment one develops the 
conceptualized image and temporarily inhibits the Hindrances, until the <i>
gotrabhū</i> thought-moment in the <i>jhāna javana</i>
process, is termed <i>upacāra-bhāvanā</i>. </p>

<p><a name='7-160' href='?#7-160'>&nbsp;</a>The thought-moment that immediately follows the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is called <i>appanā,</i> ecstatic concentration, because vitakka 
(initial application), the foremost <i>jhāna</i> constituent, persists as if 
firmly fixed upon the object of concentration. </p>

<p><a name='7-167' href='?#7-167'>&nbsp;</a>7. <b>Kasina</b> means &#39;whole, &#39;all, &#39;complete&#39;. It is so called because the 
light issuing from the conceptualized image is extended everywhere without any 
limitation.</p>

<p><a name='7-168' href='?#7-168'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of <i>pathavi-kasina</i> one makes a circle of about one span and 
four fingers in diameter and, covering it with dawn-coloured clay, smoothes it 
well. If there be not enough clay of dawn-coloured, he may put in some other 
kind of clay beneath. This prepared circle is known as <i>kasina-mandala</i> and 
is also called <i>parikamma-nimitta.</i>
Now he places this object two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on 
it, saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavi, pathavi</i> or earth, earth. The 
purpose is to gain one-pointedness of mind. When he does this for some time, 
perhaps weeks, or months, or years, he will be able to close his eyes and 
visualize the object. This visualized object is called <i>&#39;uggaha-nimitta&#39;.</i> 
Then he concentrates on this visualized image until it develops into a 
conceptualized or counter-image free from original <i>kasina</i> faults. This is 
known as the &#39;patibhāganimitta&#39;. As he continually concentrates on this abstract 
concept he is said to be in possession of proximate or neighborhood 
concentration <i>(upacāra-samādhi).</i>
At this stage the innate five Hindrances are temporarily inhibited. Eventually 
he gains &#39;ecstatic concentration&#39; <i>(appanā samādhi). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-169' href='?#7-169'>&nbsp;</a>For the water-<i>kasina</i> one may take a vessel full of colourless water, 
preferably rain water, and concentrate on it, saying - <i>āpo, āpo,</i> (water, 
water) until he gains one-pointedness of mind. </p>

<p><a name='7-170' href='?#7-170'>&nbsp;</a>To develop the fire-<i>kasina</i> one may kindle a fire before him and 
concentrate on it through a hole, a span and four fingers in diameter, in a 
rush-mat, a piece of leather, or a piece of cloth, saying <i>tejo, tejo,</i> 
(fire, fire). </p>

<p><a name='7-171' href='?#7-171'>&nbsp;</a>One who develops the air-<i>kasina</i> concentrates on the wind that enters 
through window space or a hole in the wall, saying, <i>vāyo, vāyo</i> (air, 
air).
</p>

<p><a name='7-172' href='?#7-172'>&nbsp;</a>To develop the colour-<i>kasinas</i> one may take a <i>mandala</i> of the 
prescribed size, and colour it blue, yellow, red, or white and concentrate on 
it, repeating the name of the colour as in the case of the other <i>kasinas. </i></p>

<p><a name='7-173' href='?#7-173'>&nbsp;</a>One may even concentrate on blue, yellow, red, or white flowers. </p>

<p><a name='7-174' href='?#7-174'>&nbsp;</a>Light <i>kasina</i> may be developed by concentrating on the moon, or on an 
unflickering lamplight, or on a circle of light cast on the ground, or on the 
wall by sunlight or moonlight entering through a wall-crevice or hole, saying - <i>
āloka, āloka</i> (light, light). </p>

<p><a name='7-175' href='?#7-175'>&nbsp;</a>Space-kasina can be developed by concentrating on a hole, a span and four

  Nibbāna, to be understood by the wise, each one for himself&quot;. </p>
  <p><a name='7-183' href='?#7-183'>&nbsp;</a>iii. <b>Sanghānussati</b> is the reflection on the virtues of the pure

  incomparable field of merit for the world&quot;. </p>
  <p><a name='7-184' href='?#7-184'>&nbsp;</a>iv. <b>Sīlānussati</b> is reflection on the one&#39;s own virtuous conduct.</p>

  deities as witnesses, it is called Devatānussati.</p>

  life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name='7-189' href='?#7-189'>&nbsp;</a>Contemplation on death enables one to comprehend the fleeting nature of

	endeavors to make the best use of one&#39;s life by working for self-development 
	and for the development of others, instead of wholly indulging in sensual 
	pleasures. Constant meditation on death does not make one pessimistic and

  hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, etc. This meditation on the 
  loathsomeness of the body, leads to dispassion. Many Bhikkhus in the time of 
  the Buddha attained Arahatship by meditating on these impurities. If one is

  means inhalation and <i>apāna</i> exhalation. In some books these two terms 
  are explained in the reverse way. Concentration on the breathing process leads 
  to one-pointedness of the mind, and ultimately to Insight which leads to 
  Arahatship. </p>

<p><a name='7-197' href='?#7-197'>&nbsp;</a>10. This is one of the best subjects of meditation, which appeals equally to 
all. The Buddha also practiced <i>ānāpānasati</i> before His Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='7-198' href='?#7-198'>&nbsp;</a>A detailed exposition of this meditation is found in the Satipatthāna Sutta 
and in the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p><a name='7-199' href='?#7-199'>&nbsp;</a>A few practical hints are given here for the benefit of the average reader. </p>

<p><a name='7-200' href='?#7-200'>&nbsp;</a>Adopting a convenient posture, breathe out and close the mouth. Then breathe 
in through the nostrils calmly, without strain. Inhale first and count mentally 
one. Exhale and count two, concentrating on the breathing process. In this 
manner count up to ten, constantly focusing your attention on respiration. It is 
possible for the mind to wander before one counts up to ten. But one need not be 
discouraged. Try again until success is achieved. Gradually one can increase the 
number of series, say five series of ten. Later one can concentrate on the 
breathing process without counting. Some prefer counting as it aids 
concentration; while others prefer not to count. What is essential is 
concentration, and not counting, which is secondary. When one does this 
concentration exercise one feels light in body and mind and very peaceful. One 
might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. When one practices this 
concentration for a certain period, a day may come when one will realize that 
his so-called body is supported by mere breath, and that the body perishes when 
breathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes impermanence. Where there is change 
there cannot be a permanent entity or an immortal soul. Insight might then be 
developed to gain Arahatship. </p>

<p><a name='7-201' href='?#7-201'>&nbsp;</a>It is now clear that the object of this concentration on respiration is not 
merely to gain one-pointedness but also to cultivate Insight in order to obtain 
Deliverance. </p>

<p><a name='7-202' href='?#7-202'>&nbsp;</a>This simple method may be pursued by all without any harm. </p>

<p><a name='7-203' href='?#7-203'>&nbsp;</a>For more details readers are referred to the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p><a name='7-204' href='?#7-204'>&nbsp;</a>In some Suttas this simple method of respiration is explained as follows: </p>

  equanimity or a well-balanced mind. It is the balanced state of mind amidst 
  all vicissitudes of life such as praise and blame, pain and happiness gain and 
  loss, repute and disrepute. Its direct enemy is attachment<i> (rāga)</i> and 
  its indirect enemy is callousness. Upekkhā discards clinging and aversion. 
  Impartial attitude is its chief characteristic. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a name='7-215' href='?#7-215'>&nbsp;</a>Here Upekkhā does not mean mere neutral feeling, but implies a sterling 
	virtue. Equanimity, mental equilibrium, are its closest equivalents. Upekkhā 
	embraces the good and the bad, the loved and the unloved, the pleasant and 
	the unpleasant.

<p><a name='7-374' href='?#7-374'>&nbsp;</a>24. <b>Vipassanā</b> or Insight is the third and final stage on the Path of 
Sainthood. The chief object of Insight is to understand things as they truly 
are. </p>

<p><a name='7-375' href='?#7-375'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-376' href='?#7-376'>&nbsp;</a>25. <b>Anicca,</b> i.e., the fleeting nature of both mind and matter. 
Changeableness is a characteristic of everything that is conditioned. All 
conditioned things are constantly changing, not remaining static for two 
consecutive moments. Mind, in fact, changes even faster than matter. Normally 
matter endures only for seventeen thought-moments. Commentators state that, 
during the time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments 
may arise. </p>

<p><a name='7-377' href='?#7-377'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-378' href='?#7-378'>&nbsp;</a>26. <b>Dukkha</b> - All conditioned things are subject to suffering. Birth is 
suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering. Union 
with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant is suffering. Not 
to get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates of 
attachment are suffering.</p>

<p><a name='7-380' href='?#7-380'>&nbsp;</a>27. <b>Anattā</b> - Or Soullessness is the crux of Buddhism. As there is no 
permanent entity in matter, so also there is no unchanging entity in mind 
conceived as an &#39;ego&#39; or soul&#39;. In everything mundane and supramundane 
conditioned and non-conditioned, there is no permanent soul. Hence the Buddha in 
the Dhammapada stated <i>&#39;sabbe dhammā anattā</i> - all dhammas are soulless&#39;. 
With regard to <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i>
the Buddha said <i>&#39;sankhārā</i> - conditioned things&#39;. With regard to <i>
anattā,</i>
the Buddha employed the term <i>dhammā</i> to include supramundane unconditioned 
Nibbāna as well. </p>

<p><a name='7-381' href='?#7-381'>&nbsp;</a>It may be mentioned that it was after hearing the &#39;Anattalakkhana Sutta&#39;, the 
discourse on soullessness, that the first five monks attained Arahatship. </p>

<p><a name='7-382' href='?#7-382'>&nbsp;</a>The aspirant does not usually meditate on all these three characteristics. Of 
them, he takes only that which appeals to him most. Deliverance, gained by 
meditating on one of them, is named accordingly. </p>

<p><a name='7-388' href='?#7-388'>&nbsp;</a>30. <b>Sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</b> is perfect equanimity towards all conditioned

foregoing different kinds of Insight. </p>

<p><a name='7-390' href='?#7-390'>&nbsp;</a>31. <b>Anuloma-ñāna</b> is the &#39;adaptation knowledge&#39; gained by perfecting

to 37 Factors of Enlightenment and qualifies the aspirant for the higher path. </p>

<p><a name='7-391' href='?#7-391'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-396' href='?#7-396'>&nbsp;</a>34. <b>Animitta</b> - free from the signs of permanence, etc. Emancipation

animitta-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p><a name='7-397' href='?#7-397'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-400' href='?#7-400'>&nbsp;</a>36. <b>Sīlavisuddhi</b> - Purity of Morals, is the first of seven &#39;Purities&#39;. 
It consists of four kinds, all pertaining to the life of a Bhikkhu.</p>

<p><a name='7-401' href='?#7-401'>&nbsp;</a>The first is <i>pātimokkhasamvarasīla.</i> &#39;That which saves one who observes 
it from woeful states&#39; is the commentarial explanation of <i>&#39;pātimokkha&#39;.</i> <i>
Pā</i>
is also explained as the Buddhas Teaching. <i>Atipamokkha</i> means extremely 
important. <i>Pātimokkha</i>
therefore means &quot;Fundamental Teaching&quot; or &quot;Fundamental Precepts&quot;. It deals with 
220* disciplinary rules which every Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it 
restrains one from evil deeds, etc., it is termed <i>&#39;samvara&#39;.</i> Sīla is used 
in the sense of &#39;composure&#39; <i>(samādhāna) </i>and &#39;support&#39; <i>(upadhārana).</i> 
It is so called because it tends to discipline thoughts, words, and deeds, and 
because it acts as a support for other virtues. <i>Indrivasamvarasīla</i> the 
second <i>sīla,</i> deals with the control of the six senses. <i>
ājīvapārisuddhisīla,</i> the third <i>sīla,</i>
deals with the right livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the necessaries of 
life, a Bhikkhu should not act in an unbecoming way. <i>Paccayasannissitasīla</i> 
the fourth <i>sīla,</i>
is concerned with the unselfish use of the four requisites - robes, alms, 
lodging, and medicine.</p>

<p><a name='7-404' href='?#7-404'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-405' href='?#7-405'>&nbsp;</a>37. <b>Cittavisuddhi</b> - is the second &#39;Purity. It is the purity of mind, 
gained by developing the <i>jhānas,</i> temporarily inhibiting the Hindrances. A 
purified mind is like a polished mirror where everything is reflected in its 
true perspective. With a purified mind one can see things as they truly are. </p>

<p><a name='7-406' href='?#7-406'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-407' href='?#7-407'>&nbsp;</a>38. <b>Ditthivisuddhi</b> - is the third &#39;Purity&#39;. It is so called because it 
purifies one from the false theory of a permanent soul. This correct 
comprehension results from investigating mind and matter as regards their 
salient characteristics <i>(lakkhana),</i> function or essential properties <i>
(rasa),</i> the way of manifestation <i>(paccupatthāna),</i> and their immediate 
cause <i>(padatthāna). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-408' href='?#7-408'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-409' href='?#7-409'>&nbsp;</a>39. <b>Kankhāvitaranavisuddhi</b> - is the fourth &#39;Purity&#39; which attempts to 
transcend skeptical doubts as regards cause and effect, the past, the present, 
and the future. This is called a purity because it removes the stain of 
erroneous views of &#39;chance&#39;, causelessness&#39;, etc.</p>

<p><a name='7-410' href='?#7-410'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-411' href='?#7-411'>&nbsp;</a>To achieve this purity one meditates on the various causes that tend to 
produce present mind and matter, and on the causes that sustain them in the 
present. He understands that present mind and matter at conception were 
conditioned by past ignorance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, during 
lifetime, matter is conditioned by kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and edible 
food, while mind is sustained by the senses and their corresponding objects. 
Thus he realizes the second noble truth of the cause of suffering and rids 
himself of doubts. </p>

<p><a name='7-412' href='?#7-412'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-413' href='?#7-413'>&nbsp;</a>40. <b>Maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi</b> - This is the fifth &#39;Purity&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-414' href='?#7-414'>&nbsp;</a>The aspirant ho has cleared his doubts, meditates again with better 
understanding on the three characteristics of <i>anicca, dukkha,</i> and <i>
anattā.</i>
He realizes that life is a mere flowing, a continuous undivided movement. He 
finds no genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to 
pain. What is transient is painful, and where change and sorrow prevail there 
cannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising and passing away of conditioned 
things become very conspicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed in meditation he 
witnesses an aura <i>(obhāso)</i> emanating from his body as a result of his 
keen insight. He experiences also an unprecedented joy <i>(pīti),
</i>happiness <i>(sukha),</i> and quietude <i>(passaddhi).</i> He becomes 
strenuous <i>(paggaho)
</i>and even-minded <i>(upekkhā).</i> His religious fervour increases <i>
(adhimokkha),</i>
mindfulness <i>(sati) </i>strengthens, and wisdom <i>(ñāna)</i> ripens. Laboring 
under the misconception that he has attained Sainthood, chiefly owing to the 
presence of the aura, he yearns <i>(nikanti)</i> for this state of mind. Soon he 
realizes that these temptations are only impediments <i>(upakkilesa) </i>to 
Insight, and that he has not really attained Sainthood. Accordingly he 
endeavours to distinguish between the right and wrong path <i>
(maggāmaggañānadassana).</i> It is called a &#39;purity because it clears up the 
misconception as regards the actual &#39;path&#39;. He understands, &#39;This is the right 
path, that is the wrong path&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-416' href='?#7-416'>&nbsp;</a>41. <b>Patipadāñānadassanavisuddhi</b> - is the sixth &#39;Purity&#39;. This term is 
collectively applied to the nine kinds of Insight beginning with the knowledge 
as regards the arising and passing away of conditioned things, and ending with 
the knowledge of adaptation that occurs in the Path thought-moment immediately 
preceding the <i>gotrabhū</i>
moment. (See p. <a HREF="#page429">*</a>, footnote ) </p>

<p><a name='7-419' href='?#7-419'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-420' href='?#7-420'>&nbsp;</a>43. See pp. <a HREF="#page218">218*</a>, <a HREF="#page414">414*</a>. </p>

sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</i>
and <i>anuloma-ñāna</i> of the ten kinds of Insight. It is so called because it 
leads to the Path emerging from woeful states and signs of conditioned things. </p>

<p><a name='7-423' href='?#7-423'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-424' href='?#7-424'>&nbsp;</a>45. <b>Gotrabhū</b> - lit, means &#39;overcoming the worldly lineage&#39;. The object 
of this thought-moment is Nibbāna, but the actual realization of Nibbāna by the 
eradication of passions occurs at the Path thought-moment that immediately 
follows. This particular thought-moment in the three higher stages of Sainthood 
is termed <i>&#39;vodāna&#39;</i>
(pure) as the aspirant is already an Ariya. </p>

<p><a name='7-425' href='?#7-425'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-426' href='?#7-426'>&nbsp;</a>46. Immediately after the <i>gotrabhū</i> thought-moment there arises the 
Path thought-moment of the Sotāpanna. It is at this stage that one comprehends 
the Truth of Suffering, eradicates craving, the cause of suffering, and actually 
realizes Nibbāna for the first time in his life. The eight factors that 
constitute the Noble Path are also fully developed at this stage. This 
particular thought-moment is termed <i>&#39;sotāpatti-magga&#39;.</i>
<i>Sota</i> here means the stream that leads to Nibbāna. It is the Noble 
Eightfold Path. <i>āpatti</i>
means &#39;entering for the first time&#39;. It is called <i>&#39;magga&#39;</i> because it 
arises, destroying the passions. This Path thought-moment arises only once in 
the course of one&#39;s lifetime, and is immediately followed by two or three 
&#39;Fruit&#39; <i>(phala)</i> moments before the stream of consciousness lapses into <i>
bhavanga.</i> This is the reason why the Dhamma is called <i>&#39;akālika&#39;</i> 
(immediately effective). </p>

<p><a name='7-427' href='?#7-427'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-428' href='?#7-428'>&nbsp;</a>47. <b>Paccavekkhanañānāni</b> - As a rule after each of the four stages of 
Sainthood one reflects on the Path and Fruit one has attained, on the Nibbāna 
one has realized, on the defilements one has destroyed, and in the case of the 
first three stages, on the defilements one has yet to destroy. An Arahat who has 
no more defilements to destroy knows that he is delivered. </p>

<p><a name='7-429' href='?#7-429'>&nbsp;</a>There are altogether 19 kinds of such reflective knowledge, 15 pertaining to 
the first three stages of Sainthood, and 4 to the last stage. </p>

becomes an avenue of Emancipation, and is termed &#39;Signless-contemplation. The

<p><a name='7-500' href='?#7-500'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-501' href='?#7-501'>&nbsp;</a>When the <i>jhānas</i> are developed, the mind is so purified, that it 
resembles a polished mirror, where everything is clearly reflected in true 
perspective. Still, there is not complete freedom from unwholesome thoughts, 
for, by concentration, the evil tendencies are only temporarily inhibited. They 
may rise to the surface at quite unexpected moments. </p>

<p><a name='7-502' href='?#7-502'>&nbsp;</a>Discipline regulates words and deeds; concentration controls the mind; but it 
is Insight <i>(paññā)</i> the third and the final stage, that enables the 
aspirant to Sainthood to eradicate wholly the defilements inhibited by <i>
samādhi</i>. </p>

<p><a name='7-503' href='?#7-503'>&nbsp;</a>At the outset he cultivates &#39;Purity of Vision&#39; <i>(ditthi visuddhi)</i>
(the third member of the Path of Purity) in order to see things as they truly 
are. With a one-pointed mind he analyses and examines this so-called being. This 
searching examination shows that what he has called &#39;I&#39;, is merely a complex 
compound of mind and matter which are in a state of constant flux. </p>

<p><a name='7-504' href='?#7-504'>&nbsp;</a>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of this so-called being, 
freed from the false notion of a permanent soul, he searches for the causes of 
this &#39;I&#39; personality. He realizes that there is nothing in the world which is 
not conditioned by some cause or causes, past or present, and that his present 
existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>(tanhā),</i> 
attachment <i>(upādāna),</i> Kamma, and physical food of the present life. On 
account of these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and as past causes 
have conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. 
Meditating thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to past, present and 
future (<i>kankhāvitaranavisuddhi,</i> the fourth member of the Path of Purity). </p>

<p><a name='7-505' href='?#7-505'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-506' href='?#7-506'>&nbsp;</a>Thereupon he contemplates the truth that all conditioned things are transient <i>
(anicca), </i>subject to suffering <i>(dukkha),</i> and devoid of an immortal 
soul <i>(anattā).</i> Wherever he turns his eyes he sees naught but these three 
characteristics standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a flux 
conditioned by internal and external causes. Nowhere does he find any genuine 
happiness for everything is fleeting. </p>

<p><a name='7-507' href='?#7-507'>&nbsp;</a>As he thus contemplates the real nature of life, and is absorbed in 
meditation a day comes, when, to his surprise, he witnesses an aura <i>(obhāsa)</i>
emitted by his body. He experiences an unprecedented pleasure happiness and 
quietude. He becomes even-minded, his religious fervour increases, mindfulness 
becomes clear and insight keen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress 
for Sainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking 
for this mental state. Soon the realization comes that these new developments 
are impediments to moral progress and he cultivates the purity of knowledge with 
regard to the Path and Non-Path (<i>maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi,</i>
the fifth member of the Path of Purity).</p>

<p><a name='7-508' href='?#7-508'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-509' href='?#7-509'>&nbsp;</a>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of all conditioned things. Of 
these two states the latter becomes more impressed on his mind since change is 
more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he directs his attention to 
contemplation of the dissolution of things
<i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He perceives that both mind and matter which constitute 
this so-called being are in a state of constant flux, not remaining the same for 
two consecutive moments. To him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving 
things are fearful <i>(bhaya ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a 
pit of burning embers, a source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the 
wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava ñāna) </i>of the fearful and deluded world, 
and develops a feeling of disgust <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i> followed by a strong 
will for deliverance from it <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p><a name='7-510' href='?#7-510'>&nbsp;</a>With this object in view, he resumes his meditation on the three 
characteristics of transiency, sorrow, and soullessness <i>(patisankhā ñāna),</i> 
and thereafter develops complete equanimity towards all conditioned things, 
having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly object <i>(upekkhā 
ñāna).*</i> <a NAME="page429"></a></p>

<p><a name='7-516' href='?#7-516'>&nbsp;</a>Reaching this point of spiritual culture, he chooses one of the three

<p><a name='7-521' href='?#7-521'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;As the traveler by night sees the landscape around him by a flash of 
lightning, and the picture so obtained swims long thereafter before his dazzled 
eyes, so the individual seeker, by the flashing light of insight, glimpses 
Nibbāna with such clearness that the after-picture never more fades from his 
mind&quot;. (Dr. Paul Dahlke)</p>

<p><a name='7-522' href='?#7-522'>&nbsp;</a>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time he is called a 
Sotāpanna (s<font SIZE="2">ee Chapter I)</font> - one who has entered the stream 
that leads to Nibbāna for the first time. </p>

<p><a name='7-523' href='?#7-523'>&nbsp;</a>The Stream represents the noble Eightfold Path. </p>

<p><a name='7-524' href='?#7-524'>&nbsp;</a>A Stream-Winner is no more a worldling (puthujjana), but an Ariya (Noble). </p>

<p><a name='7-525' href='?#7-525'>&nbsp;</a>On attaining this first stage of Sainthood he eradicates the following three 
Fetters <i>(samyojana)</i> that bind him to existence, namely: </p>

<p><a name='7-526' href='?#7-526'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a name='7-527' href='?#7-527'>&nbsp;</a>1. <b>Sakkāya-ditthi</b> - <i>sati + kāye + ditthi,</i> literally, view 
  when a group exists. Here <i>kāya</i> refers to the five Aggregates of matter, 
  feeling, perception, mental states, and consciousness, or, in other words, to 
  the complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging 
  entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho physical 
  aggregates is termed <i>sakkāya-ditthi.</i>
  Dhammasangani enumerates twenty kinds of such soul theories (s<font SIZE="2">ee 
  Dhammasangani Translation, pp. 257-259)</font>. <i>Sakkāya-ditthi</i> is 
  usually rendered by self-illusion, theory of individuality, illusion of 
  individualism. </p>
  <p><a name='7-528' href='?#7-528'>&nbsp;</a>2. <b>Vicikicchā</b> - Doubts. They are doubts about 1. the Buddha, 2. the 
  Dhamma, 3. the Sangha, 4. the disciplinary rules <i>(sikkhā), </i>5. the past, 
  6. the future, 7. both the past and the future, and 8. Dependent Arising <i>
  (paticca-samuppāda).</i>
  (see Dhammasangani Translation p. 239)</p><p><a name='7-529' href='?#7-529'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Sīlabbataparāmāsa</b> - Adherence to (wrongful) rites and 
	ceremonies. </p>
  <p><a name='7-530' href='?#7-530'>&nbsp;</a>Dhammasangani explains it thus: &quot;It is the theory held by ascetics an 
  Brahmins outside this doctrine, that purification is obtained by rules of 
  moral conduct, or by rites, or by both rules of moral conduct and rites&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='7-531' href='?#7-531'>&nbsp;</a>For the eradication of the remaining seven Fetters a Sotāpanna is reborn 
seven times at most. He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and 
the Sangha. He would not for any reason violate any of the five precepts. He is 
not subject to states of woe as he is destined for Enlightenment. </p>

<p><a name='7-532' href='?#7-532'>&nbsp;</a>With fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, the noble 
pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight, becomes a Sakadāgāmi - 
Once-Returner - reaching the second stage of Sainthood by attenuating two other 
Fetters, namely, sense-desires <i>(kāmāraga)</i> and ill will <i>(patigha).</i> </p>

<p><a name='7-533' href='?#7-533'>&nbsp;</a>Now he is called a Once-Returner because he is born in the human realm only 
once, should he not attain Arahatship in that birth itself. It is interesting to 
note that the Ariya Saint who has attained the second stage of Sainthood can 
only weaken these two powerful Fetters with which he is bound from a 
beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he harbours thoughts of 
lust and anger. </p>

<p><a name='7-534' href='?#7-534'>&nbsp;</a>It is by attaining the third State of Sainthood, that of the Anāgāmi 
(Never-Returner), that he completely eradicates these two Fetters. Thereafter he 
neither returns to this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, since he 
has rooted out the desire for sensual gratification. After death he is reborn in 
the Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsa), an environment exclusively reserved for Anāgāmis 
and Arahats. </p>

<p><a name='7-535' href='?#7-535'>&nbsp;</a>A layman may become an Anāgāmi, provided he leads a celibate life. </p>

<p><a name='7-536' href='?#7-536'>&nbsp;</a>The Anāgāmi Saint now makes his final advance and destroying the remaining 
five Fetters, namely, attachment to Realms of Form <i>(rūparāga)</i>
attachment to Formless Realms <i>(arūparāga),</i> pride <i>(māna), </i>
restlessness <i>(uddhacca),
</i>and ignorance <i>(avijjā), </i>attains Arahatship the final state of 
Sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='7-537' href='?#7-537'>&nbsp;</a>Stream-Winners, Once-Returners, Never-Returners are called Sekhas because 
they have yet to undergo training. Arahats are called Asekhas because they no 
longer need any training. </p>

<p><a name='7-538' href='?#7-538'>&nbsp;</a>An Arahat, literally, a Worthy One, is not subject to rebirth because he does 
not accomplish fresh Karmic activities, the seeds of his reproduction in matter 
have all been destroyed. </p>

<p><a name='7-539' href='?#7-539'>&nbsp;</a>The Arahat realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done. A heavy 
burden of sorrow has finally been relinquished, and all forms of craving and all 
shades of ignorance are totally annihilated. The happy pilgrim now stands on 
heights more than celestial, far removed from uncontrolled passions and the 
defilements of the world. </p>

their respective fruits. </p>

<p><a name='7-573' href='?#7-573'>&nbsp;</a>But &#39;the Attainment to Cessation (56) is possible only to Never-Returners and 
Arahats. </p>

<p><a name='7-574' href='?#7-574'>&nbsp;</a>In this case, one attains successively to the great ecstasies like the first <i>
jhāna,</i> etc., and emerging therefrom contemplates on the conditioned things 
in each of those <i>jhānas.</i> Thus he proceeds up to &#39;the State of 
Nothingness&#39;. Then, having attended to the preliminary duties such as resolving, 
etc., he attains to the state of Neither-Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;. Now 
after two ecstatic <i>javana</i>
thought-moments his stream of consciousness is suspended. Thereafter he attains 
to (Supreme) &#39;Cessation&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='7-575' href='?#7-575'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='7-576' href='?#7-576'>&nbsp;</a>At the time of rising, if to a Never-Returner, an Anāgāmi Fruit consciousness 
or to an Arahat, an Arahat Fruit consciousness, occurs only for a single moment 
and then lapses into <i>bhavanga.</i> This is followed by the knowledge of 
reflection. </p>

<p><a name='7-579' href='?#7-579'>&nbsp;</a>One who wishes to enjoy the essence of practice in this Dispensation should 
thus develop the sublime dual meditation. </p>

<p><a name='7-586' href='?#7-586'>&nbsp;</a>As invited by Namba, a person of refined manners, belonging to a respectable 
family, full of faith and replete with sterling virtues, to compose a treatise 
out of compassion for others, this book has been completed. </p>

<p><a name='7-587' href='?#7-587'>&nbsp;</a>By this great merit may the modest monks, ho are purified by wisdom and who

<p><a name='7-592' href='?#7-592'>&nbsp;</a>56. <b>Nirodhasamāpatti</b> - Lit., &#39;attainment to cessation&#39;. It is so 
called because during this period the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases 
to flow. Mind is suspended, but vitality persists. </p>

<p><a name='7-593' href='?#7-593'>&nbsp;</a>It is only an Anāgāmi or an Arahat who has developed the <i>rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i> <i>jhānas</i> who can attain to this supreme state of ecstasy. </p>

<p><a name='7-594' href='?#7-594'>&nbsp;</a>When such a person wishes to attain to <i>nirodhasamāpatti,</i> he first 
attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> and, emerging from it, he meditates on the 
transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of conditioned states found in that 
particular
<i>jhāna.</i> Likewise, he attains, in order, to the remaining <i>jhānas</i> and 
meditates in the same way until the <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of &#39;Nothingness&#39;.</p>

<p><a name='7-595' href='?#7-595'>&nbsp;</a>Emerging from this <i>jhāna,</i> he makes the following four resolutions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><a name='7-596' href='?#7-596'>&nbsp;</a>(i) that his fourfold requisites be not destroyed, </p>
        <p><a name='7-597' href='?#7-597'>&nbsp;</a>(ii) that he should arise in time when his services are needed by the 
		Sangha, </p>
        <p><a name='7-598' href='?#7-598'>&nbsp;</a>(iii) that he should arise in time when he is summoned by the Buddha, </p>
        <p><a name='7-599' href='?#7-599'>&nbsp;</a>(iv) whether he will live for more than seven days from that moment. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='7-600' href='?#7-600'>&nbsp;</a>He has to think of his age-limit as this ecstatic state normally extends to 
seven days. </p>

<p><a name='7-601' href='?#7-601'>&nbsp;</a>After making these resolutions, he attains to the last <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of 
&#39;Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;, and remains in that state for two <i>
javana</i>
thought moments. Immediately after, he attains to <i>nirodha-samāpatti</i> when 
his stream of consciousness, is temporarily suspended. After seven days he 
emerges from this state and experiences for a single moment an Anāgāmi Phala 
consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat Phala consciousness in the 
case of an Arahat. Thereafter arises the <i>bhavanga citta. </i></p>
