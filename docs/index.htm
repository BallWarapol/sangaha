<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abhidhamma, as the term implies, is the Higher Teaching of the Buddha. It 
expounds the quintessence of His profound doctrine. </p>

<p>The Dhamma, embodied in the Sutta Pitaka, is the conventional teaching <i>
(vohāra desanā),</i> and the Abhidhamma is the ultimate teaching <i>(paramattha 
desanā)</i> </p>

<p>In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, which constitute this complex 
machinery of man, are microscopically analyzed. Chief events connected with the 
process of birth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of the 
Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms. </p>

<p>Modern Psychology, limited as it is comes within the scope of Abhidhamma 
inasmuch as it deals with the mind, with thoughts, thought-processes, and mental 
states but it does not admit of a psyche or a soul. Buddhism teaches a 
psychology without a psyche. </p>

<p>If one were to read the Abhidhamma as a modern textbook on psychology, one 
would be disappointed. No attempt has here been made to solve all the problems 
that confront a modern psychologist. </p>

<p>Consciousness is defined. Thoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from 
an ethical standpoint. All mental states are enumerated. The composition of each 
type of consciousness is set forth in detail. The description of 
thought-processes that arise through the five sense-doors and the mind-door is 
extremely interesting. Such a clear exposition of thought-processes cannot be 
found in any other psychological treatise. </p>

<p><i>Bhavanga</i> and <i>Javana</i> thought-moments, which are explained only 
in the Abhidhamma, and which have no parallel in modern psychology, are of 
special interest to a research student in psychology. </p>

<p>That consciousness flows like a stream, a view propounded by some modern 
psychologists like William James, becomes extremely clear to one who understands 
the Abhidhamma. It must be added that an Abhidhamma student can fully comprehend 
the <i>Anattā</i>
(No-soul) doctrine, the crux of Buddhism, which is important both from a 
philosophical and an ethical standpoint. </p>

<p>The advent of death, process of rebirth in various planes without anything to 
pass from one life to another, the evidently verifiable doctrine of Kamma and 
Rebirth are fully explained. </p>

<p>Giving a wealth of details about mind, Abhidhamma discusses the second factor 
of man-matter or <i>rūpa.</i> Fundamental units of matter, material forces, 
properties of matter, source of matter, relationship of mind and matter, are 
described. </p>

<p>In the Abhidhammattha Sangaha there is a brief exposition of the Law of 
Dependent Origination, followed by a descriptive account of the Causal Relations 
that finds no parallel in any other philosophy. </p>

<p>A physicist should not delve into Abhidhamma to get a thorough knowledge of 
physics. </p>

<p>It should be made clear that Abhidhamma does not attempt to give a 
systematized knowledge of mind and matter. It investigates these two composite 
factors of so-called being to help the understanding of things as they truly 
are. A philosophy has been developed on these lines. Based on that philosophy, 
an ethical system has been evolved to realize the ultimate goal, Nibbāna. </p>

<p>As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly says, Abhidhamma deals with &quot;(1) What we find (a) 
within us (b) around us and of (2) what we aspire to find.&quot; </p>

<p>In Abhidhamma all irrelevant problems that interest students and scholars, 
but having no relation to one&#39;s Deliverance, are deliberately set aside. </p>

<p>The Abhidhammattha Sangaha, the authorship of which is attributed to 
venerable Anuruddha Thera, an Indian monk of Kanjevaram (Kāñcipura), gives an 
epitome of the entire Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is still the most fitting 
introduction to Abhidhamma. By mastering this book, a general knowledge of 
Abhidhamma may easily be acquired. </p>

<p>To be a master of Abhidhamma all the seven books, together with commentaries 
and sub-commentaries, have to be read and re-read patiently and critically. </p>

<p>Abhidhamma is not a subject of fleeting interest designed for the superficial 
reader. </p>

<p>To the wise truth-seekers, Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide and an 
intellectual treat. Here there is food for thought to original thinkers and to 
earnest students who wish to increase their wisdom and lead an ideal Buddhist 
life.</p>

<p>However, to the superficial, Abhidhamma must appear as dry as dust. </p>

<p>It may be questioned, &quot;Is Abhidhamma absolutely essential to realize Nibbāna, 
the summum bonum of Buddhism, or even to comprehend things as they truly are?&quot; </p>

<p>Undoubtedly Abhidhamma is extremely helpful to comprehend fully the word of 
the Buddha and realize Nibbāna, as it presents a key to open the door of 
reality. It deals with realities and a practical way of noble living, based on 
the experience of those who have understood and realized. Without a knowledge of 
the Abhidhamma one at times&#39; finds it difficult to understand the real 
significance of some profound teachings of the Buddha. To develop Insight <i>
(vipassanā) </i>Abhidhamma is certainly very useful.
</p>

<p>But one cannot positively assert that Abhidhamma is absolutely necessary to 
gain one&#39;s Deliverance. </p>

<p>Understanding or realization is purely personal <i>(sanditthika).</i>
The four Noble Truths that form the foundation of the Buddha&#39;s teaching are 
dependent on this one fathom body. The Dhamma is not apart from oneself. Look 
within, Seek thyself. Lo, the truth will unfold itself. </p>

<p>Did not sorrow-afflicted Patācārā, who lost her dear and near ones, realize 
Nibbāna; reflecting on the disappearance of water that washed her feet? </p>

<p>Did not Cūlapanthaka, who could not memorize a verse even for four months, 
attain Arahantship by comprehending the impermanent nature of a clean 
handkerchief that he was handling, gazing at the sun? </p>

<p>Did not Upatissa, later venerable Sāriputta Thera, realize Nibbāna, on 
hearing half a stanza relating to cause and effect? </p>

<p>To some a fallen withered leaf alone was sufficient to attain Pacceka Buddha 
hood.</p>

<p>It was mindfulness on respiration <i>(ānāpāna-sati) </i>that acted as the 
basis for the Bodhisatta to attain Buddha hood. </p>

<p>To profound thinkers, a slight indication is sufficient to discover great 
truths. </p>

<p>According to some scholars, Abhidhamma is not a teaching of the Buddha, but 
is a later elaboration of scholastic monks. </p>

<p>Tradition, however, attributes the nucleus of the Abhidhamma to the Buddha 
Himself. </p>

<p>Commentators state that the Buddha, as a mark of gratitude to His mother who 
was born in a celestial plane, preached the Abhidhamma to His mother Deva and 
others continuously for three months. The principal topics <i>(mātikā)</i> of 
the advanced teaching such as moral states<i> (kusalā dhammā), </i>immoral 
states <i>(akusalā dhammā) </i>and indeterminate states <i>(abyākatā dhammā), </i>
etc., were taught by the Buddha to venerable Sāriputta Thera, who subsequently 
elaborated them in the six books (Kathāvatthu being excluded) that comprise the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka. </p>

<p>Whoever the great author or authors of the Abhidhamma may have been, it has 
to be admitted that he or they had intellectual genius comparable only to that 
of the Buddha. This is evident from the intricate and subtle Patthāna Pakarana 
which minutely describes the various causal relations. </p>

<p>It is very difficult to suggest an appropriate English equivalent for 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>There are many technical terms, too, in Abhidhamma which cannot be rendered 
into English so as to convey their exact connotation. Some English equivalents 
such as consciousness, will, volition, intellect, perception are used in a 
specific sense in Western Philosophy. Readers should try to understand in what 
sense these technical terms are employed in Abhidhamma. To avoid any 
misunderstanding, due to preconceived views, Pāli words, though at times 
cumbersome to those not acquainted with the language, have judiciously been 
retained wherever the English renderings seem to be inadequate. To convey the 
correct meaning implied by the Pāli terms, the etymology has been given in many 
instances. </p>

<p>At times Pāli technical terms have been used in preference to English 
renderings so that the reader may be acquainted with them and not get confused 
with English terminology. </p>

<p>Sometimes readers will come across unusual words such as corruption, 
defilement, volitional activities, functional, resultants, and so forth, which 
are of great significance from an Abhidhamma standpoint. Their exact meaning 
should be clearly understood.</p>

<p>In preparing this translation, Buddhist Psychology by Mrs. Rhys Davids and 
the Compendium of Philosophy (Abhidhammattha Sangaha) by Mr. Shwe Zan Aung 
proved extremely helpful to me. Liberty has been taken to quote them wherever 
necessary with due acknowledgment.</p>

<p>My grateful thanks are due to the Kandy Buddhist Publication Society for the 
printing of this fourth revised volume, to the printers for expediting the 
printing, to Miss Rañjani Goonatilaka for correcting the proofs, and to Ven. 
Bhikkhu Bodhi for his useful suggestions. </p>

<p>Above all I have to thank Mr. Lankatilaka, a most distinguished artist of Sri 
Lanka, for his beautiful and symbolical dust jacket design. </p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Abhidhammattha-Sangaha</b> is the name of the book. Abhidhamma, 
literally, means &quot;Higher Doctrine&quot;. <em>Attha</em> here means &quot;things&quot;. <em>
Sangaha</em> means &quot;a compendium&quot;. </p>

<p>The prefix &quot;<em>abhi</em>&quot; is used in the sense of preponderant, great, 
excellent, sublime, distinct, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Dhamma</b> is a multi-significant term, derived from the root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>dhar,</i> to hold, to support. Here the Pāli term is used in the 
sense of doctrine or teaching. According to the Atthasālini, &quot;<i>abhi</i>&quot; 
signifies either &quot;<i>atireka</i>&quot; -higher, greater, exceeding - or &quot;<i>visittha</i>&quot; 
- distinguished, distinct, special, sublime. </p>

<p>Abhidhamma means the Higher Doctrine because it enables one to achieve one&#39;s 
Deliverance, or because it exceeds the teachings of the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya 
Pitaka. </p>

<p>In the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka the Buddha has used conventional terms 
such as man, animal, being, and so on. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka, on the 
contrary, everything is microscopically analyzed and abstract terms are used. As 
a distinction is made with regard to the method of treatment, it is called 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>Thus, chiefly owing to the preponderance of the teachings, or because it is 
conducive to one&#39;s Deliverance, and owing to the excellent analytical method of 
treatment, it is called Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. The <b>Abhidhamma Pitaka</b> consists of seven treatises - namely, </p>

<p>(<em>Dhammasangani Vibhangañ ca - Kathāvatthu ca Puggalam

<a name='6-1' href='?#6-1'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h3>i. <b>Dhammasangani</b> - &quot;Classification of Dhammas&quot;. </h3>

<p>This book is divided into four chapters, viz:- </p>

<dl>
  <dd>
  <p>(1) - (Citta) Consciousness, </dd>
  <dd>
  <p>(2) - (Rūpa) Matter, </dd>
  <dd>
  <p>(3) - (Nikkhepa) Summary, </dd>
  <dd>
  <p>(4) - (Atthuddhāra) Elucidation. </dd>
</dl>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 22 <b>Tika Mātikās</b> (Triplets) and the 100 <b>Duka-Mātikās</b>
(Couplets), which comprise the quintessence of the Abhidhamma, are explained in 
this book. The major part of the book is devoted to the explanation of the first 
triplet - <em>kusalā dhammā, akusalā dhammā</em> and <em>abyākatā dhammā</em>. 
In extent the book exceeds thirteen Bhānavāras* (recitals), i.e., more than 
104,000 letters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>* Bhānavāra = 250 verses: 1 verse = 4 lines: 1 line = 8 letters. One 
	Bhānavāra, therefore, consists of 8000 letters</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name='6-2' href='?#6-2'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h3>ii. <b>Vibhanga</b> - &quot;Divisions&quot;.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are eighteen divisions in this book. </p>

<p>The first three divisions, which deal with </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p><i>khandha</i> (aggregates) </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>āyatana</i> (sense-spheres) and </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhātu</i> (elements), </li>
</ul>

<p>are the most important. </p>

<p>The other chapters deal with </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p><i>sacca</i> (truths,) </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>indriya</i> (controlling faculties), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>paccayākāra</i> (causal genesis), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>satipatthāna</i> (foundations of mindfulness), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>samma-ppadhāna</i> (supreme efforts), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>iddhi-pāda</i> (means of accomplishments), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>bojjhanga</i> (factors of wisdom), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>jhāna</i> (ecstasies or absorption), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>appamaññā</i> (illimitable), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>magga</i> (paths), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>sikkhā-pada</i> (precepts), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>patisambhidā</i> (analytical knowledge), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>ñāna</i> (wisdom), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>khuddaka-vatthu</i> (minor subjects), and </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhamma-hadaya</i> (essence of truth). </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of these divisions consist of three parts - Suttanta explanation, 
Abhidhamma explanation, and a Catechism (Pañhapucchaka). </p>

<p>In this treatise there are thirty-five Bhānavāras (280,000 letters).</p>

<a name='6-3' href='?#6-3'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h3>iii. <b>Dhātukathā</b> - &quot;Discussion with reference to Elements&quot;. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This book discusses whether Dhammas are included or not included in, 
associated with, or dissociated from: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>aggregates <i>(khandha),</i> </li>
  <li>
  <p>bases <i>(āyatana),</i> and </li>
  <li>
  <p>elements <i>(dhātu). </i></li>
</ul>

<p>There are fourteen chapters in this work. In extent it exceeds six Bhānavāras 
(48,000 letters). </p>

<a name='6-4' href='?#6-4'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h3>iv. <b>Puggalapaññatti</b> - &quot;Designation of Individuals&quot;.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the method of exposition this book resembles the Anguttara Nikāya of the 
Sutta Pitaka. Instead of dealing with various Dhammas, it deals with various 
types of individuals. There are ten chapters in this book. The first chapter 
deals with single individuals, the second with pairs, the third with groups of 
three, etc. In extent it exceeds five Bhānavāras (40,000 letters). </p>

<a name='6-5' href='?#6-5'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h3>v. <b>Kathāvatthu</b> - &quot;Points of Controversy&quot;</h3>

<p>The authorship of this treatise is ascribed to Venerable Moggalliputta Tissa 
Thera, who flourished in the time of King Dhammāsoka. It was he who presided at 
the third Conference held at Pātalaliputta (Patna) in the 3rd century B.C. This 
work of his was included in the Abhidhamma Pitaka at that Conference. </p>

<p>The Atthasālini Commentary states that it contains one thousand Suttas: five 
hundred orthodox and five hundred heterodox. In extent it is about the size of 
the Dīgha Nikāya. </p>

<p>This book deals with 216 controversies and is divided into 23 chapters.

<h3>vi. <b>Yamaka</b> - &quot;The Book of Pairs&quot;. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is so called owing to its method of treatment. Throughout the book a 
question and its converse are found grouped together. For instance, the first 
pair of the first chapter of the book, which deals with roots, runs as follows: 
Are all wholesome Dhammas wholesome roots? And are all wholesome roots wholesome 
Dhammas? </p>

<p>This book is divided into ten chapters - namely, </p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p><i>mūla</i> (roots), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>khandha</i> (aggregates), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>āyatana</i> (bases), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhātu</i> (elements), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>sacca</i> (truths), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>sankhāra</i> (conditioned things), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>anusaya</i> (latent dispositions), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>citta</i> (consciousness), </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>dhamma,</i> and </li>
  <li>
  <p><i>indriya</i> (controlling faculties). </li>
</ol>

<p>In extent it contains 120 Bhānavāras (960,000 letters). </p>

<h3>vii. <b>Patthāna</b> - &quot;The Book of Causal Relations&quot;. </h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the most important and the most voluminous book of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. One who patiently reads this treatise cannot but admire the profound 
wisdom and penetrative insight of the Buddha. There is no doubt of the fact that 
to produce such an elaborate and earned treatise one must certainly be an 
intellectual genius. </p>

<p>The term Patthāna is composed of the prefix &quot;pa&quot;, various and &quot;thāna&quot;, 
relation or condition <i>(paccaya).</i> It is so called because it deals with 
the 24 modes of causal relations (explained in a subsequent chapter) and the 
triplets <i>(tika)</i> and couplets <i>(duka)</i> already mentioned in the 
Dhammasangani, and which comprise the essence of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. </p>

<p>The importance attached to this treatise, also known as &quot;Mahā Pakarana&quot;, the 
Great Book, could be gauged by the words of the Atthasālini which states: &quot;And 
while He contemplated the contents of the Dhammasangani His body did not emit 
rays, and similarly with the contemplation of the next five books. But, when 
coming to the Great Book, He began to contemplate the 24 universal causal 
relations of condition of presentation, and so on, His omniscience certainly 
found its opportunity therein.* </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Realities</b> - There are two realities - apparent and ultimate. 
Apparent reality is ordinary conventional truth <i>(sammuti-sacca).</i> Ultimate 
reality is abstract truth <i>(paramattha-sacca). </i></p>

<p>For instance, the smooth surface of the table we see is apparent reality. In 
an ultimate sense the apparent surface consists of forces and qualities or in 
other words, vibrations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For ordinary purposes a scientist would use the term water, but in the 
laboratory he would say H2O. In the same way the Buddha in the Sutta Pitaka 
resorts to conventional usage such as man, woman, being, self, etc., but in the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka He adopts a different mode of expression. Here He employs the 
analytical method and uses abstract terms such as aggregates <i>(khandha),</i> 
elements <i>(dhātu),</i> bases <i>(āyatana),</i>
etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The word <i>paramattha</i> is of great significance in Abhidhamma. It is a 
compound formed of <i>parama</i> and <i>attha.</i> <i>Parama</i> is explained as 
immutable <i>(aviparīta), </i>abstract (<i>nibbattita);</i> <i>attha</i> means 
thing. <i>Paramattha,</i>
therefore, means immutable or abstract thing. Abstract reality may be suggested 
as the closest equivalent. Although the term immutable is used here it should 
not be understood that all <i>paramattha</i> are eternal or permanent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A brass vessel, for example, is not <i>paramattha.</i> It changes every 
moment and may be transmuted into a vase. Both these objects could be analyzed 
and reduced into fundamental material forces and qualities, which, in 
Abhidhamma, are termed <i>rūpa paramattha.</i> They are also subject to change, 
yet the distinctive characteristics of these <i>rūpas</i> are identically the 
same whether they are found in a vessel or a vase. They preserve their identity 
in whatever combination they are found - hence the commentarial interpretation 
of <i>parama</i> as immutable or real. <i>Attha</i> exactly corresponds to the 
English multi-significant term &quot;thing&quot;. It is not used in the sense of &quot;meaning&quot; 
here. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are four such <i>paramattha</i> or abstract realities. These four 
embrace everything that is mundane or supra mundane. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The so-called being is mundane. Nibbāna is supra mundane. The former is 
composed of <i>nāma</i> and <i>rūpa.</i> According to Abhidhamma <i>rūpa</i>
connotes both fundamental units of matter and material changes as well. As such 
Abhidhamma enumerates 28 species of matter. These will be dealt with in a 
subsequent chapter. <i>Nāma,</i>
denotes both consciousness and mental states. The second chapter of this book 
deals with such mental states <i>(cetasikas)</i> which are 52 in number. One of 
these is <i>vedanā</i>
(feeling). Another is <i>saññā</i> (perception). The remaining 50 are 
collectively called <i>sankhāra</i> (mental states). The receptacle of these 
mental properties is <i>viññāna</i>
(consciousness), which is the subject-matter of this present chapter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the above analysis the so-called being is composed of five 
Groups or Aggregates <i>(pañcakkhandha):</i>- <i>rūpa</i> (matter), <i>vedanā</i>
(feeling), <i>saññā</i> (perception), s<i>ankhāra</i> (mental states) and <i>
viññāna</i>
(consciousness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consciousness, mental states (with the exception of 8 types of supra mundane 
consciousness and their adjuncts), and matter are Mundane<i> (lokiya),</i> and 
Nibbāna is Supra mundane <i>(lokuttara).</i> The Supra mundane Nibbāna is the 
only absolutely reality, which is the summum bonum of Buddhism. The other three 
are called realities in that they are things that exist <i>(vijjamāna dhammā).</i> 
Besides, they are irreducible, immutable, and abstract things. They deal with 
what is within us and around us. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first <i>paramattha</i> or reality is <i>citta.</i> It is derived from 
the root <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>citi,</i> to think. According to the 
commentary <i>citta</i> is that which is aware of <i>(cinteti = vijānāti)</i> an 
object. It is not that which thinks of an object as the term implies. From an 
Abhidhamma standpoint <i>citta</i> may better be defined as the awareness of an 
object, since there is no agent like a soul. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Citta, ceta, cittuppāda, nāma, mana, viññāna</b> are all used as 
synonymous terms in Abhidhamma. Hence from the Abhidhamma standpoint no 
distinction is made between mind and consciousness. When the so-called being is 
divided into its two constituent parts, <i>nāma</i> (mind) is used. When it is 
divided into five aggregates<i>
(pañcakkhandha), viññāna</i> is used. The term <i>citta</i> is invariably 
employed while referring to different classes of consciousness. In isolated 
cases, in the ordinary sense of mind, both terms <i>citta</i> and <i>mana</i> 
are frequently used. </p>

<p>The other three <i>paramatthas</i> will be dealt with in their due places. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>5. <b>Kāma</b> is either subjective sensual craving or sensuous objects such 
as forms, sound, odor, taste, and contact. By <i>kāma</i> is also meant the 
eleven different kinds of sentient existence-namely, the four states of misery <i>
(apāya),
</i>human realm <i>(manussaloka), </i>and, six celestial realms <i>(sagga). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Avacara</b> means that which moves about or that which frequents. <i>
Kāmāvacara,</i>
therefore, means that which mostly moves about in the sentient realm, or that 
which pertains to the senses and their corresponding objects. As a rule, these 
types of consciousness arise mostly in the aforesaid sentient existence. They 
are found in other spheres of life as well when objects of sense are perceived 
by the mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="page11"></a>6. <b>Rūpāvacara, Arūpāvacara</b> respectively mean 
either that which pertains to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa jhānas</i> (ecstasies) or 
that which mostly moves about in the <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> planes. </p>

<p><i>Rūpalokas</i> are planes where those who develop <i>rūpa jhānas</i>
are born. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A question now arises - &#39;Why are these distinguished as <i>rūpalokas</i>
when there are subtle material bodies <i>(rūpa)</i> in heavenly planes too?&#39; The 
commentarial explanation is that because beings are born in these planes by 
developing <i>jhānas</i>
based mainly on <i>rūpa</i> <i>kasinas,</i> - material objects of concentration 
such as earth, water, fire, etc. </p>

<p><i>Arūpalokas</i> are planes without material bodies. By the power of 
meditation, only the mind exists in these planes. </p>

<p>Ordinarily both mind and body are inseparable, but by will-power, under 
exceptional circumstances, they could be separated, just as it is possible to 
suspend a piece of iron in air by some magnetic force. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Loka + Uttara</b> = Lokuttara. Here <i>Loka,</i> means the five 
aggregates. <i>Uttara</i> means above, beyond or that which transcends. It is 
the supra-mundane consciousness that enables one to transcend this world of 
mind-body </p>

<p>The first three classes of consciousness are called <i>lokiya</i>
(mundane). </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>8. <b>Akusala, Kusala, Vipāka, Kiriya- </b></p>

<p>In the previous section consciousness was broadly classified under four 
divisions according to the planes in which it is experienced. With respect to 
its nature it divides itself into four classes. Some types of consciousness are 
immoral <i>(akusala),
</i>because they spring from attachment <i>(lobha),</i> aversion or ill-will <i>
(patigha),</i>
and ignorance <i>(moha).</i> Opposed to them are the moral types of 
consciousness<i>
(kusala), </i>because they are rooted in non-attachment or generosity <i>
(alobha),</i>
goodwill <i>(adosa), </i>and wisdom <i>(amoha).</i> The former are unwholesome 
as they produce undesirable effects <i>(anittha vipāka), </i>the latter are 
wholesome as they produce desirable effects <i>(ittha vipāka).</i> Both <i>
kusala</i> and <i>akusala cittas</i>
constitute what, in Pāli, are termed <i>kamma.</i> Those types of consciousness 
that arise as the inevitable results of these <i>kusala</i> and <i>akusala 
cittas</i> are called <i>vipāka</i> (resultant) <i>cittas.</i> It should be 
understood that both <i>kamma</i>
and <i>vipāka</i> are purely mental. The fourth type of consciousness is called <i>
kiriya</i>
which, for want of a better term, is rendered by &quot;karmically ineffective&quot;, 
&quot;inoperative&quot; or &quot;functional&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Three Roots (Mūla)-</b> </p>

<p><i>Lobha, dosa,</i> and <i>moha</i> are the three roots of evil. Their 
opposites are the roots of good. </p>

<p><i>Lobha,</i> from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lubh,</i> to cling, or 
attach itself, may be rendered by &#39;attachment&#39; or &#39;clinging&#39;. Some scholars 
prefer &#39;greed&#39;. Craving is also used as an equivalent of <i>lobha. </i></p>

<p>In the case of a desirable object of sense, there arises, as a rule, clinging 
or attachment. In the case of an undesirable object, ordinarily there is 
aversion. </p>

<p>In Pāli such aversion is termed <i>dosa</i> or <i>patigha. Dosa</i> is 
derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dus,</i> to be displeased. <i>
Patigha</i> is derived from <i>&#39;pati&#39;,</i> against, and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>
&#39;gha&#39; (han),</i>
to strike, to contact. Ill-will, hatred are also suggested as equivalents of <i>
&#39;patigha&#39;.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Moha</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muh,</i>
to delude. It is delusion, stupidity, bewilderment. It is <i>&#39;moha&#39;</i> that 
clouds an object and blinds the mind. Sometimes <i>&#39;moha&#39;</i> is rendered by 
ignorance. </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma, <i>moha</i> is common to all evil. <i>Lobha</i>
and <i>dosa</i> do not arise alone, but always in combination with <i>moha. 
Moha,</i> on the other hand, does arise singly-hence the designation <i>
&#39;momūha&#39;,</i> intense delusion. </p>

<p>Diametrically opposed to the above three roots are the roots of <i>kusala.</i>
They not only indicate the absence of certain evil conditions, but also signify 
the presence of certain positive good conditions. <i>Alobha</i> does not merely 
mean non-attachment, but also generosity. <i>Adosa</i> does not merely mean 
non-anger or non-hatred, but also goodwill, or benevolence, or loving-kindness <i>
(mettā). Amoha </i>does not merely mean non-delusion, but also wisdom or 
knowledge <i>(ñāna</i> or <i>paññā).
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Vedanā or Feeling-</b> </p>

<p><a NAME="MORCON5"></a>Feeling or, as some prefer to say, sensation, is a 
mental state common to all types of consciousness. Chiefly there are three kinds 
of feelings -namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>somanassa</i> (pleasurable), </li>
  <li> <i>domanassa</i> (displeasurable),
  </li>
  <li> <i>upekkhā</i> (indifferent, neutral, equanimity or neither pleasurable 
  nor dis-pleasurable). </li>
</ul>

<p>With </p>

<ul>
  <li> <i>dukkha</i> (physical pain) </li>
  <li> <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness) </li>
</ul>

<p>there are altogether five kinds of feelings. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Somanassa</i> is an abstract noun formed of <i>&#39;su&#39;,</i> good, and <i>
&#39;mana&#39;,</i>
mind. Literally, the term means good-mindedness, i.e., a pleasurable feeling.  </p>

<p>Similarly <i>&#39;domanassa&#39;</i>
<i>(&#39;du&#39;,</i> bad, and <i>&#39;mana&#39;,</i> mind) means bad-mindedness i.e., a 
dis-pleasurable feeling.  </p>

<p>The third feeling is neutral. Indifference is used here in this particular 
sense, but not in the sense of callousness. <i>Sukha</i> is composed of <i>&#39;su&#39;,</i> 
easy, and <i>&#39;kha&#39;</i>
to bear, or to endure. What is easily endured is <i>&#39;sukha&#39;</i> i.e., happiness. <i>
Dukkha (du,</i> difficult), pain, is that which is difficult to be endured. Both 
these sensations are physical.  </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma there is only one type of consciousness accompanied 
by pain, and one accompanied by happiness. Two are connected with a 
dis-pleasurable feeling. Of the 89 types of consciousness, in the remaining 85 
are found either a pleasurable feeling or a neutral feeling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Somanassa, domanassa,</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> are purely mental. <i>Sukha</i>
and <i>dukkha</i> are purely physical. This is the reason why there is no <i>
upekkhā</i>
in the case of touch which, according to Abhidhamma, must be either happy or 
painful. (See Upekkhā, 
<a href="#42-Upekkha">Note. 42</a>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Ditthi-</b> </p>

<p>This term is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>&#39;dis&#39;,</i>
to see, to perceive. It is usually translated as view, belief, opinion, etc. 
When qualified by <i>&#39;samma&#39;,</i> it means right view or right belief; when 
qualified by <i>&#39;micchā&#39;,</i>
it means wrong view or wrong belief. Here the term is used without any 
qualification in the sense of wrong view. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Sankhārika-</b> </p>

<p><a NAME="NOTE33"></a></p>

<p>This is purely a technical term used in a specific sense in the Abhidhamma. 
It is formed of <i>&#39;sam&#39;,</i> well and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>&#39;kar&#39;,</i>
to do, to prepare, to accomplish. Literally, it means accomplishing, preparing, 
arranging.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like <i>dhamma, sankhāra</i> also is a multi-significant term. Its precise 
meaning is to be understood according to the context. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When used as one of the five &#39;aggregates&#39; <i>(pañcakkhandha),</i> it refers 
to all the mental states, except <i>vedanā</i> and <i>saññā.</i> In the <i>
paticca-samuppāda</i>
it is applied to all moral and immoral activities, good and bad thoughts. When <i>
sankhāra</i>
is used to signify that which is subject to change, sorrow, etc., it is 
invariably applied to all conditioned things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this particular instance the term is used with <i>&#39;sa&#39; =</i> co-; and <i>a 
=</i> un, <i>Sa-sankhārika</i> (lit., with effort) is that which is prompted, 
instigated, or induced by oneself or by another. <i>&#39;Asankhārika&#39;</i> (lit., 
without effort) is that which is thus unaffected, but done spontaneously. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If, for instance, one does an act, induced by another, or after much 
deliberation or premeditation on one&#39;s part, then it is <i>sa-sankhārika.</i> 
If, on the contrary, one does it instantly without any external or internal 
inducement, or any premeditation, then it is <i>asankhārika.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Vicikicchā-</b> </p>

<p>This is an ethic-religious term. Commentary gives two interpretations. </p>

<p>(1.) <i>Vici = vicinanto,</i> seeking, inquiring; - <i>kicch,</i> to tire, to 
strain, to be vexed. It is vexation due to perplexed thinking. </p>

<p>(2.) <i>Vi,</i> devoid + <i>cikicchā,</i> remedy (of knowledge). It means 
that which is devoid of the remedy of knowledge. </p>

<p>Both these interpretations indicate a perplexed or undecided frame of mind. 
Doubt, perplexity, skepticism, indecision are used as the closest English 
equivalents. </p>

<p>Reasoning or investigation for the sake of understanding the truth is not 
discouraged in Buddhism. Nor is blind faith advocated in Buddhism. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2"><i>&nbsp;</p>

</i></font>

<p>[Vicihicchā is the inability to decide anything definitely that it is as 
such. Buddhaghosa-Majjhima Nikāya Commentary.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Uddhacca-</b> </p>

<p>This is formed of <i>u</i> = over, and - <i>dhu,</i> to tremble, to get 
excited. Literally, it means &#39;over-excitement&#39; or &#39;rousing up&#39;. A confused 
restless state of mind is meant here. It is the antithesis of one-pointedness. 
Atthasālini explains <i>uddhacca</i>
as disquietude, mental distraction or confusion. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Kusala and Akusala-</b> </p>

<p>This section deals with <i>akusala</i> types of consciousness. <i>Akusala</i>
is the direct opposite of <i>kusala.</i> Atthasālini gives the etymological 
meaning of <i>kusala</i>
as follows:- </p>

<p>(1.) <i>ku,</i> bad, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sal,</i> to shake, to 
tremble, to destroy. That which shakes off, destroys evil or contemptible things 
is <i>kusala.</i> </p>

<p>(2.) <i>kusa</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lu,</i> to cut. </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kusa</i> is from <i>ku,</i> bad, and <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>si,</i>
to lie. That which lies contemptibly is <i>kusa,</i> vice. <i>Kusala</i> is that 
which cuts off vice. </p>

<p>(3.) a.) <i>ku,</i> evil, bad, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>su,</i>
to reduce. That which reduces or eradicates evil is <i>kusa,</i> knowledge or 
wisdom. <i>Kusa,</i>
so derived, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>lu,</i> to cut. That which cuts 
off (evil) by wisdom is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>b.) <i>Kusa,</i> so derived, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>la,</i>
to take. That which is grasped by wisdom is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>(4.) Kusa grass cuts a part of the hand with both edges. Even so <i>kusala</i>
cuts off both sections of passions - those that have arisen and those that have 
not arisen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With regard to the connotation of the term the Atthasālini states:- </p>

<p>&quot;The word <i>kusala</i> means &#39;of good health&#39; <i>(ārogya),</i>
&#39;faultless&#39; <i>(anavajja),</i> &#39;clever&#39; <i>(cheka),</i> &#39;productive of happy 
results&#39; <i>(sukha-vipāka)&quot;.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the exception of &#39;clever&#39; all the other three meanings are applicable to <i>
kusala.</i> </p>

<p><i>Kusala</i> is wholesome in the sense of being free from physical and 
mental sickness through passions. </p>

<p><i>Kusala</i> is faultless in the sense of being free from the fault of 
passions, the evil of passions, and the heat of passions. </p>

<p>Here <i>sukha-vipāka</i> does not necessarily mean pleasurable feeling. It is 
used in the sense of physical and mental buoyancy, softness, fitness, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atthasālini further states <i>kusala</i> is used in the sense of having 
accomplished with wisdom <i>(kosallasambhūtatthena; kosallam vuccati paññā).</p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Judging from the various meanings attached to the term, <i>kusala</i>
may be interpreted as wholesome or moral. Some scholars prefer &#39;skillful&#39;.</p>

<p><i>Akusala</i> would therefore mean unwholesome or immoral. </p>

<p><i>Kusala</i> and <i>akusala</i> correspond to good and bad, right and wrong 
respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. How are we to assess whether an action is <i>kusala</i> or <i>akusala?</i>
What is the criterion of morality?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short what is connected with the three roots of evil is <i>akusala.</i>
What is connected with the three roots of good is <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>As a seed sown on fertile soil germinates and fructifies itself sooner or 
later, according to its own intrinsic nature, even so <i>kusala</i> and <i>
akusala</i>
actions produce their due desirable and undesirable effects. They are called <i>
vipāka.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Kiriya or Kriyā</b>, literally, means action. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here <i>Kiriya</i> is used in the sense of ineffective action. <i>Kamma</i>
is causally effective. <i>Kiriya</i> is causally ineffective. Good deeds of 
Buddhas and Arahats are called <i>kiriya</i> because <i>kamma</i> is not 
accumulated by them as they have gone beyond both good and evil. </p>

<p>In Abhidhamma <i>vipāka</i> and <i>kiriya</i> are collectively called <i>
avyākata</i>
(Indeterminate), that which does not manifest itself in the way of an effect. 
The former is <i>avyākata,</i> because it is an effect in itself, the latter, 
because it does not produce an effect. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES FOR THE TWELVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMMORAL 
CONSCIOUSNESS:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Attachment</b></p>

<p>(1.) With joy a boy instantly steals an apple, viewing no evil thereby.
</p>

<p>(2.) Prompted by a friend, a boy joyfully steals an apple, viewing no evil 
thereby. </p>

<p>(3.) (4.) The same illustration serves for the third and fourth types of 
consciousness with the difference that the stealing is done</p>

<p>without any false view. </p>

<p>(5.) (6.) (7.) (8.) The remaining four types of consciousness are similar to 
the above with the difference that the stealing is done with neutral feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Ill-will</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(9.) With hatred one murders another without any premeditation. </p>

<p>(10.) With hatred one murders another after premeditation. </p>

<p>19. <b>Killing:-</b> According to Abhidhamma killing is invariably done with 
ill-will or aversion. Prompted by whatever motive, one, as a rule, kills with a 
thought of ill-will. Where there is ill-will <i>(patigha)</i> there is 
displeasure <i>(domanassa).</i>
Where there is displeasure there is ill-will in a subtle or gross way. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, a little child, who cannot discriminate between right 
and wrong, smilingly kills an ant. He does not know that he is committing the 
evil of killing. He is only playing with it. Now, does he cherish any ill-will 
towards the ant? Is there any hatred or ill-feeling in his case? It is difficult 
to say so. What type of consciousness does he experience at that moment? It 
cannot be the 9th and 10th types because he innocently does it with joy, 
fondling the object. Could it be the third type of consciousness rooted in <i>
&quot;lobha&quot;? </i></p>

<p>An adult who kills for sport does experience the 9th or 10th type of 
consciousness. There is ill-feeling at the moment of killing. </p>

<p>What about vivisection? A scientist may vivisect without the least 
compunction. His chief motive may be scientific investigation for consequent 
alleviation of suffering. Yet, there is the thought of killing. </p>

<p>Does one experience ill-will when one kills a wounded animal with the object 
of putting an end to its suffering? Moved by compassion, one may do so; yet 
there is ill-will at the moment of killing, because there is a certain kind of 
aversion towards the object. If such an action is morally justifiable, could one 
object to the wholesale destruction of patients suffering from acute chronic 
incurable diseases? </p>

<p>It was stated above that there is ill-will where there is displeasure. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When, for instance, one feels sorry for having failed in an examination, does 
one harbor ill-will at that time? If one reflects on the meaning of the term <i>
patigha,</i> the answer will become clear. There is no doubt a subtle kind of 
aversion over the unpleasant news. It is the same in the case of a person who 
weeps over the death of a dear one, because it is an unwelcome event. Anāgāmis 
and Arahats never feel sorry nor grieve, because they have eradicated <i>patigha</i> 
or <i>dosa</i> (hatred or ill-will). </p>

<p>Great was the lamentation of Venerable Ananda, who was a Sotāpanna Saint, on 
the passing away of the Buddha; but Arahats and Anāgāmis like Venerable Kassapa 
and Anuruddha, practiced perfect equanimity without shedding a tear. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Ignorance </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(11.) A person doubts the existence of the Buddha, or the efficacy of the 
Dhamma, owing to his stupidity. </p>

<p>(12.) A person is distracted in mind, unable to concentrate on an object. </p>

<p>As these two types of consciousness are feeble, due to stupidity or dullness 
of mind, the accompanied feeling is neither pleasurable nor displeasurable, but 
neutral. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. The ten kinds of <i>akusala</i> (evil) in relation to the twelve types of 
immoral consciousness. </p>

<p>There are ten kinds of evil committed through deed, word and thought. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>DEED- (1) Killing <i>(pānātipāta),</i> (2) Stealing. <i>(adinnādāna),</i>
    (3) Sexual Misconduct <i>(kāmesu-micchācāra).</p>

      (6) Harsh speech <i>(pharusa-vācā),</i> (7) Vain talk <i>(samphappalāpa).</i> </p>
    <p>THOUGHT- (8) Covetousness <i>(abhijjhā),</i> (9) Hatred <i>(vyāpāda),</i>
    and (10) False view <i>(micchā-ditthi)*.</i> </p>

      (b) Denying both the cause and the result<i> (Ahetuka)</i> and (c) Denying 
	  Kamma <i>(Akiriya-Ditthi):-</i>
      These constitute wrong views.]</p>
    </font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>All these <i>akusalas</i> are committed by the afore-mentioned twelve types 
of <i>akusala</i> consciousness. Killing is generally done by the 9th and 10th 
types of consciousness. Stealing is generally done with the first eight types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Sexual misconduct is committed with the first eight types of consciousness.</p>

<p>Theft may be committed with a hateful thought too. In such a case there is 
the possibility of stealing with the 9th and 10th types of consciousness.</p>

<p>Lying may be uttered with the first ten types of consciousness; and so is 
slandering. </p>

<p>Harsh speech is uttered with the 9th and 10th types of consciousness. Vain 
talk may spring from the first ten types of consciousness. Covetousness springs 
from the first eight types of consciousness. Hatred springs from the 9th and 
10th types of consciousness. False views spring from the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. <b>Eradication of the Akusala Cittas by the four classes of Aryan 
disciples.</b> </p>

<p>A Sotāpanna (Stream-Winner) eradicates the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, and 11th types 
of consciousness as he has destroyed the two Fetters <i>(samyojana)</i>-s<i>akkāya-ditthi</i>
(Self-illusion) and <i>vicikicchā</i> (Doubts). </p>

<p>A Sakadāgāmi (Once-Returner), who has attained the second stage of Sainthood, 
weakens the potentiality of the 9th and 10th types of consciousness, because he 
has only attenuated the two Fetters - <i>kāmarāga</i> (Sense-desire) and <i>
patigha</i>
(Hatred). </p>

<p>An Anāgāmī (Never-Returner), who has attained the third stage of Sainthood, 
eradicates the above two types of consciousness as he has completely destroyed 
the said two Fetters. </p>

<p>An Arahat does not give rise to any of the twelve <i>akusala cittas</i>
as he has eradicated the remaining five Fetters too - namely, <i>rūparāga</i>
(Attachment to <i>rūpa</i> <i>jhānas</i> and Form-Spheres), <i>arūparāga</i>
(Attachment to <i>arūpa jhānas</i> and Formless-Spheres), <i>māna</i> (Conceit), <i>
uddhacca</i>
(Restlessness) and <i>avijjā</i> (Not-knowingness or Ignorance). </p>

<p><i>(sīlabbata paramasa </i>- Indulgence in wrongful rites and ceremonies, one 
of the ten Fetters, not mentioned above, is eradicated by a Sotāpanna). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>These three are the functional types of consciousness without <i>Hetu</i>.
</p>

<p>Thus end, in all, the eighteen types of consciousness without <i>Hetu</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven are immoral resultants. Moral resultants are Eightfold. </p>

<p>Three are functionals. <i>Ahetukas</i> are eighteen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Note: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="hetu"></a>23. <b>Hetu</b> is usually rendered by &#39;causal condition&#39;. 
In the Suttas we often come across such phrases as <i>&#39;ko hetu, ko paccayo&#39;,</i>
- &#39;what cause, what reason&#39;. In the Abhidhamma both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i> 
are differentiated and are used in specific senses. The term <i>hetu</i> is 
applied to the six roots explained above. <i>Paccaya</i> is an aiding condition<i> 
(upakāraka dhamma). </i>Like the root of a tree is hetu. <i>Paccaya</i> is like 
water, manure, etc. </p>

<p>The aforesaid eighteen classes of consciousness are called <i>&#39;a-hetuka&#39;</i>
because they are devoid of &#39;concomitant hetus&#39; <i>(sampayuttaka hetu).</i> It 
must be understood that even <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are not devoid of an 
efficient cause <i>(nibbattaka hetu). </i>The remaining 71 classes of 
consciousness are called <i>Sa-hetuka,</i> with Roots. In two there is only one 
Root, in sixty nine there are two or three Roots. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Dvipañcaviññāna</b> - Five pairs of moral and immoral resultant 
consciousness are enumerated here. They are so called because they are dependent 
on the five senses. As they are comparatively weak they are accompanied by 
neutral feeling, with the exception of body-consciousness which is accompanied 
by either pain or happiness. It should be noted that, in the Abhidhamma, these 
five pairs of consciousness are sometimes referred to as <i>&#39;dvipancaviññāna&#39;,</i> 
the two <i>sampaticchana cittas</i>
and <i>pañca-dvārāvajjana citta</i> as <i>&#39;mano dhātu&#39; </i>(mind-element), the 
rest (76) as <i>&#39;mano viññāna dhātu&#39;</i> (mind-consciousness element). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Sampaticchana</b> is that moment of consciousness which accepts or 
receives an object. <i>Santīrana</i> is that which investigates an object. That 
moment of consciousness which turns towards one of the five sense-objects is 
called the <i>pañca-dvārāvajjana. Mano-dvārāvajjana</i> is that moment of 
consciousness which turns the mind towards a mental object. <i>
Pañca-dvārāvajjana</i> and <i>mano-dvārāvajjana</i> are the only two moments of <i>
kiriya cittas</i> experienced by those who are not Arahats. All the other <i>
kiriya cittas</i> are experienced only by Buddhas and Arahats. It is this <i>
mano-dvārāvajjana citta</i> that performs the function of <i>votthapana</i> 
(deciding) which will be dealt with later. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Hasituppāda</b> is a <i>citta</i> peculiar to Arahats. Smiling is 
caused by a pleasurable feeling. There are thirteen classes of consciousness by 
which one may smile according to the type of the person. An ordinary worldling <i>
(puthujjana)</i>
may laugh with either one of the four types of cittas rooted in attachment, 
accompanied by pleasure, or one of the four <i>kusala cittas,</i> accompanied by 
pleasure. </p>

<p>Sotāpannas, Sakadāgāmīs, and Anāgāmīs may smile with one of the two <i>
akusala cittas,</i> disconnected with false view, accompanied by pleasure, or 
with one of the four <i>kusala cittas.</i> </p>

<p>Arahats and Pacceka Buddhas may smile with one of the four <i>sobhana kiriya 
cittas</i> or <i>hasituppāda. </i></p>

<p>Sammā Sambuddhas smile with one of the two <i>sobhana kiriya cittas,</i>
accompanied by wisdom and pleasure. </p>

<p>There is nothing but mere mirth in the <i>hasituppāda</i>
consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Compendium of Philosophy states: &quot;There are six classes of laughter 
recognized in Buddhist works: (1) <i>sita: -</i> a smile manifesting itself in 
expression and countenance; (2) <i>hasita: -</i> a smile consisting in the 
slight movements of the lips just enough to reveal the tips of the teeth; (3) <i>
vihasita: - </i>laughter giving out a light sound; (4) <i>upahasita: - </i>
laughter accompanied by the movement of the head, shoulders, and arms; (5) <i>
apahasita: - </i>laughter accompanied by the shedding of tears; and (6) <i>
atihasita: - </i>an outburst of laughter accompanied by the forward and backward 
movements of the entire body from head to foot. Laughter is thus a form of 
bodily expression<i> (kāya-viññatti),</i> which may or may not be accompanied by 
vocal expression <i>(vacī-viññatti).</i> Of these, the first two classes are 
indulged in by cultured persons, the next two by the average man, and the last 
two by the lower classes of being. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Thought-Process</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subject, the consciousness, receives objects from within and without. 
When a person is in a state of profound sleep his mind is said to be vacant, or, 
in other words, in a state of <i>bhavanga.</i> We always experience such a 
passive state when our minds do not respond to external objects. This flow of <i>
bhavanga</i> is interrupted when objects enter the mind. Then the <i>bhavanga</i> 
consciousness vibrates for one thought-moment and passes away. Thereupon the 
sense-door consciousness <i>(pañca-dvārāvajjana)</i>
arises and ceases. At this stage the natural flow is checked and is turned 
towards the object. Immediately after there arises and ceases the eye 
consciousness* <i>(cakkhu viññāna),</i> but yet knows no more about it. This 
sense operation is followed by a moment of reception of the object so seen <i>
(sampaticchana).</i> Next comes the investigating faculty <i>(santīrana)</i> or 
a momentary examination of the object so received. After this comes that stage 
of representative cognition termed the determining consciousness <i>
(votthapana). </i>Discrimination is exercised at this stage. Freewill plays its 
part here. Immediately after there arises the psychologically most important 
stage - Impulsion or <i>javana.</i> It is at this stage that an action is judged 
whether moral or immoral. <i>Kamma</i> is performed at this stage; if viewed 
rightly <i>(yoniso manasikāra),</i> the <i>javana</i> becomes moral; if viewed 
wrongly <i>(ayoniso manasikāra), </i>it becomes immoral. In the case of an 
Arahat this <i>javana</i> is neither moral nor immoral, but merely functional<i> 
(kiriya).</i> This <i>javana</i> stage usually lasts for seven thought moments, 
or, at times of death, five. The whole process which happens in an infinitesimal 
part of time ends with the registering consciousness <i>(tadālambana),</i>
lasting for two thought-moments - thus completing one thought-process at the 
expiration of seventeen thought-moments. </p>

<p>*[i.e., if the object is a form<i> (rūpa). </i>This consciousness depends on 
the five objects of sense.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three kinds of <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness are <i>vipāka.</i>
They are either one of the two <i>santīrana cittas,</i> accompanied by 
indifference, mentioned above, or one of the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas,</i> 
described in section 6. <i>Pañca-dvārāvajjana</i> is a <i>kriyā citta. Pañca 
viññāna</i> is one of the ten moral and immoral <i>vipāka cittas.</i> <i>
Sampaticchana</i> and <i>santīrana</i>
are also <i>vipāka cittas.</i> The <i>mano-dvārāvajjana</i> (mind-door 
consciousness), a <i>kriyā citta,</i> functions as the <i>votthapana</i> 
consciousness. One can use one&#39;s freewill at this stage. The seven <i>javana</i> 
thought-moments constitute <i>kamma.</i>
The <i>tadālambana</i> is a <i>vipāka citta</i> which is one of the three <i>
santīrana cittas</i> or one of the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus in a particular thought-process there arise various thought-moments 
which may be <i>kamma, vipāka,</i> or <i>kriyā</i>. </p>

<p>THOUGHT PROCESS: According to Abhidhamma when an object is presented to the 
mind through one of the five doors a thought process runs as follows:- </p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moral, resultant, and functional types of consciousness of the sensuous 
sphere, with Hetus, which differ according to feeling knowledge, and inducement, 
should be understood as twenty-four. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the sensuous sphere twenty-three are &quot;Resultant&quot;, twenty &quot;Moral&quot; and 
&quot;Immoral&quot;, and eleven are &quot;Functional&quot;, fifty-four in all. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Sobhana</b> - so called because they yield good qualities, and are 
connected with blameless roots such as generosity, loving-kindness, and 
knowledge. Com. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Pāpa</b> - is that which leads to misery. Evil or bad is a better 
rendering than sin which has a Christian outlook. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Hetuka</b> - All the <i>cittas</i> that are to be described hereafter, 
are called <i>sahetukas,</i> with Roots, opposed to the <i>ahetukas</i> of the 
foregoing section. Of the twenty-four <i>kāmāvacara sobhana cittas,</i> twelve 
are connected with two good Roots: generosity <i>(alobha)</i> and 
loving-kindness <i>(adosa);</i>
twelve with three good: hetus - generosity, loving-kindness, and knowledge <i>
(amoha).</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. Fifty-nine or ninety-one: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the eight <i>lokuttara cittas</i> are developed by means of each of the 
five <i>kusala rūpa jhānas,</i> as will be explained at the end of this chapter, 
they total forty. </p>

<p>Then 24 + 15 + 12 + 40 = 91. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Ñāna</b> - is that which understands the reality (Com.) Here <i>ñāna</i>
is synonymous with wisdom, reason, or knowledge. It is opposed to <i>moha</i> 
(ignorance, delusion, or stupidity). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the commentary one does a good act on the spur of the moment 
without any particular inducement either from within or without, owing to 
physical and mental fitness, due to good food, climate, etc., and as a result of 
having performed similar actions in the past. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. All good acts are done by one of these first eight <i>cittas.</i>
Their corresponding effects are the eight resultant <i>cittas.</i> The eight <i>
ahetuka vipāka cittas</i> are also the due effects of these <i>kusala cittas.</i> 
It, therefore, follows that there are sixteen <i>vipāka cittas</i> corresponding 
to eight <i>kusala cittas,</i> whereas in the case of twelve <i>akusala cittas</i> 
there are only seven <i>ahetuka vipāka cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Buddhas and Arahats also experience all these twenty-three types of
<i>vipāka cittas</i> as they are bound to reap the good and bad effects of their 
past actions till they die. But they do not experience the first eight <i>kusala 
cittas</i> as they do not accumulate fresh <i>kamma</i> that has any 
reproductive power, since they have eradicated all fetters that bind oneself to 
existence. When they do any good act, instead of the usual <i>kusala cittas,</i> 
they experience the eight <i>kriyā cittas</i> which possess no reproductive 
energy. Ordinary persons and even Holy Ones of the first three grades of Saint 
ship do not experience these eight <i>cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. Illustrations for the first eight <i>kusala cittas:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. One understandingly gives something to a beggar at once with joy. </p>

<p>2. One understandingly gives something to a beggar with joy, after 
deliberation, or being induced by another. </p>

<p>3. A child, without any understanding, joyfully salutes a monk at once. 
Joyfully a person automatically recites a Sacred Text without understanding the 
meaning. </p>

<p>4. A child, without any understanding, joyfully salutes a monk, as instructed 
by the mother. A person joyfully repeats a Sacred Text, as taught by another, 
without understanding the meaning. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining four types should be understood in the same way, substituting 
indifference for joy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Form-Sphere consciousness is fivefold according to different Jhānas. That 
becomes fifteen fold according to Moral, Resultant and Functional types. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Rūpāvacara- </b></p>

<p>There are three planes of existence-namely, Sensuous Sphere <i>(kāmaloka),
</i>Form-Sphere <i>(rūpaloka),</i> and Formless-Sphere <i>(arūpaloka).</i> The 
four states of misery <i>(apāya),</i> human realm <i>(manussa),</i> and the six 
celestial realms <i>(devaloka)</i> constitute the <i>kāmaloka. </i>It is so 
called because sense-desires play a predominant part in this sphere. The four 
states of misery are called
<i>duggati</i> (evil states). Evil-doers are born in such states. The remaining 
seven are called <i>sugati</i> (good states). The good are born in these states 
of sensuous bliss. </p>

<p>The more evolved persons, who seek no delight in ordinary sense-desires, but 
are interested in higher spiritual progress, must naturally be born in congenial 
places in harmony with their lofty aspirations. Even in the human realm it is 
they who retire to solitude and engage themselves in meditation. </p>

<p>Such meditation <i>(bhāvanā)</i> is of two kinds - <i>samatha</i>
(concentration) and <i>vipassanā</i> (insight). <i>Samatha,</i> which means 
calm, or tranquillity is gained by developing the Jhānas. <i>Vipassanā</i> is 
seeing things as they truly are. With the aid of Jhānas one could develop higher 
psychic powers <i>(abhiññā).</i>
It is <i>vipassanā</i> that leads to Enlightenment. </p>

<p>Those who develop Jhānas are born after death in higher Form-Spheres <i>
(rūpaloka)
</i>and Formless-spheres <i>(arūpaloka). </i></p>

<p>In the Formless-Spheres there is no body but only mind. As a rule, both mind 
and body are interrelated, interdependent, and inseparable. But by will-power 
there is a possibility for the mind to be separated from the body and vice versa 
temporarily. Beings born in celestial realms and Form-Spheres are supposed to 
posses very subtle material forms. </p>

<p>The Compendium of Philosophy states that &quot;<i>Rūpaloka</i> is so called 
because the subtle residuum of matter is said, in that place of existence, to be 
still met with. Arūpaloka is so called because no trace of matter is held to be 
found in it&quot;. </p>

<p>That which frequents the <i>Rūpa-</i>Sphere is <i>rūpāvacara.</i>
There are fifteen <i>cittas</i> pertaining to it. Five are <i>kusalas,</i> which 
one can develop in this life itself. Five are their corresponding <i>vipākas</i> 
which are experienced after death in the <i>Rūpa-</i>sphere. Five are <i>kriyā 
cittas,</i> which are experienced only by Buddhas and Arahats either in this 
life or by Arahats in the <i>Rūpa</i>-Sphere.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Jhāna</b> - Sanskrit <i>dhyāna</i>- </p>

<p>The Pāli term is derived from the root <i>&quot;jhe&quot;,</i> to think. Venerable 
Buddhaghosa explains Jhāna as follows, <i>&quot;Aramman&#39;upanijjhānato 
paccanīkajhāpanato vajhanam&quot;, </i>Jhāna is so called because it thinks closely 
of an object or because it burns those adverse things (hindrances - <i>
nīvaranas).</i></p>

<p>By Jhāna is meant willful concentration on an object. </p>

<p>Of the forty objects of concentration, enumerated in the 9th chapter of this 
book, the aspirant selects an object that appeals most to his temperament. This 
object is called <i>parikamma nimitta</i> - preliminary object. </p>

<p>He now intently concentrates on this object until he becomes so wholly 
absorbed in it that all adventitious thoughts get <i>ipso facto</i> excluded 
from the mind. A stage is ultimately reached when he is able to visualize the 
object even with closed eyes. On this visualized image <i>(uggaha nimitta)</i> 
he concentrates continuously until it develops into a conceptualized image <i>
(patibhāga nimitta). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an illustration let us take the <i>pathavī kasina.</i></p>

<p>A circle of about one span and four inches in diameter is made and the 
surface is covered with dawn-colored clay and smoothed well. If there be not 
enough clay of the dawn color, he may put in some other kind of clay beneath. 
This hypnotic circle is known as the <i>parikamma nimitta.</i> Now he places 
this object about two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on it, 
saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavī</i> or earth. The purpose is to gain 
the one-pointedness of the mind. When he does this for some time - perhaps 
weeks, or months, or years - he would be able to close his eyes and visualize 
the object. This visualized object is called <i>uggaha nimitta.</i> Then he 
concentrates on this visualized image, which is an exact mental replica of the 
object, until it develops into a conceptualized image which is called <i>
patibhāga nimitta.</i> </p>

<p>The difference between the first visualized image and the conceptualized 
image is that in the former the fault of the device appears, while the latter is 
clear of all such defects and is like a &quot;well-burnished conchshell&quot;. The latter 
possesses neither color nor form. &quot;It is just a mode of appearance, and is born 
of perception&quot;. </p>

<p>As he continually concentrates on this abstract concept he is said to be in 
possession of &quot;proximate concentration&quot; <i>(upacāra samādhi) </i>and the innate 
five Hindrances to progress <i>(nīvarana),</i> such as sense-desire <i>
(kāmacchanda),</i>
hatred <i>(patigha),</i> sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha),</i> restlessness 
and brooding <i>(uddhacca-kukkucca), </i>and doubts <i>(vicikicchā)</i> are 
temporarily inhibited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually he gains &quot;ecstatic concentration&quot; <i>(appanā samādhi)</i> and 
becomes enwrapped in Jhāna, enjoying the calmness and serenity of a one-pointed 
mind. </p>

<p>As he is about to gain <i>appanā samādhi</i> a thought process runs as 
follows:- <i>bhavanga, mano-dvārāvajjana, parikamma, upacāra, anuloma, gotrabhū, 
appanā. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the stream of consciousness is arrested, there arises the Mind-door 
consciousness taking for its object the <i>patibhāga nimitta.</i> This is 
followed by the Javana process which, as the case may be, starts with either <i>
parikamma</i>
or <i>upacāra.</i> <i>Parikamma</i> is the preliminary or initial 
thought-moment. <i>Upacāra</i>
means proximate, because it is close to the <i>appanā samādhi.</i> It is at the <i>
anuloma</i>
or &quot;adaptation&quot; thought-moment that the mind qualifies itself for the final <i>
appanā.</i>
It is so called because it arises in conformity with <i>appanā.</i> This is 
followed by <i>gotrabhū,</i>
the thought-moment that transcends the <i>kāma</i>-plane. <i>Gotrabhū</i> means 
that which subdues <i>(bhū)</i> the Kāma-lineage <i>(gotra).</i> All the 
thought-moments of this Javana process up to the <i>gotrabhū</i> moment are <i>
kāmāvacara</i> thoughts. Immediately after this transitional stage of <i>
gotrabhū</i> there arises only for a duration of one moment the <i>appanā</i> 
thought-moment that leads to ecstatic concentration. This consciousness belongs 
to the <i>Rūpa</i>-plane, and is termed the First <i>Rūpa</i> Jhāna. In the case 
of an Arahat it is a <i>kriyā citta,</i> otherwise it is a <i>kusala. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This consciousness lasts for one thought-moment and then subsides into the <i>
Bhavanga</i> state. </p>

<p>The aspirant continues his concentration and develops in the foregoing manner 
the second, third, fourth, and fifth Jhānas. </p>

<p>The five Jhāna <i>vipākas</i> are the corresponding Resultants of the five 
Morals. They are experienced in the Form sphere itself and not in the <i>Kāma</i>-sphere.
<i>Kusala</i> and <i>Kiriyā</i> Jhānas could be experienced in the <i>Kāma</i>-sphere 
continuously even for a whole day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The five factors, <i>vitakka, vicāra, pīti, sukha, ekaggatā</i>
collectively found in the <i>appanā</i> consciousness, constitute what is 
technically known as Jhāna. In the second Jhāna the first factor is eliminated, 
in the third the first two are eliminated, in the fourth the first three are 
eliminated, while in the fifth even happiness is abandoned and is substituted by 
equanimity. </p>

<p>Sometimes these five Jhānas are treated as four, as mentioned in the 
Visuddhi-Magga. In that case the second Jhāna consists of three constituents as 
both <i>vitakka</i>
and <i>vicāra</i> are eliminated at once. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Vitakka</b> - is derived from <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>
&quot;takk&quot;</i> to think. Generally the term is used in the sense of thinking or 
reflection. Here it is used in a technical sense. It is that which directs the 
concomitant states towards the object. <i>(ārammanam vitakketi sampayuttadhamme 
abhiniropeti&#39; ti vitakko).</i> Just as a king&#39;s favourite would conduct a 
villager to the palace, even so <i>vitakka</i> directs the mind towards the 
object. </p>

<p><i>Vitakka</i> is an unmoral mental state which, when associated with a
<i>kusala</i> or <i>akusala citta,</i> becomes either moral or immoral. A 
developed form of this <i>vitakka</i> is found in the first Jhāna consciousness. 
A still more developed form of <i>vitakka</i> is found in the Path-consciousness <i>
(magga citta)</i> as <i>sammā-sankappa</i>
(Right thoughts). The <i>vitakka</i> of the Path-consciousness directs the 
mental states towards Nibbāna and destroys <i>micchā</i> (wrong or evil) <i>
vitakka</i> such as thoughts of sense-desire <i>(kāma), </i>thoughts of hatred <i>
(vyāpāda),</i> and thoughts of cruelty <i>(vihimsā).</i> The <i>vitakka</i> of 
the Jhāna consciousness temporarily inhibits sloth and torpor <i>(thīna-middha)</i> 
one of the five Hindrances <i>(nīvarana).</i></p>

<p>Through continued practice the second Jhāna is obtained by eliminating
<i>vitakka.</i> When four Jhānas are taken into account instead of the five, the 
second Jhāna is obtained by eliminating both <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> at 
the same time.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Vicāra</b> is derived from <i>&quot;vi&quot;</i> + <i>&quot;car&quot;</i>
to move or wander. Its usual equivalent is investigation. Here it is used in the 
sense of sustained application of the mind on the object. It temporarily 
inhibits doubts <i>(vicikicchā).
</i></p>

<p>According to the commentary <i>vicāra</i> is that which moves around the 
object. Examination of the object is its characteristic. <i>Vitakka</i> is like 
the flying of a bee towards a flower. <i>Vicāra</i> is like its buzzing around 
it. As Jhāna factors they are correlates. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Pīti</b> is zest, joy, or pleasurable interest. It is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>&quot;pi&quot;,</i> to please, to delight. It is not a kind of feeling <i>
(vedanā)</i> like <i>sukha.</i> It is, so to say, its precursor. Like the first 
two Jhāna factors, <i>(pīti)</i> is also a mental state found in both moral and 
immoral consciousness. Creating an interest in the object is its characteristic <i>
pīti</i>
inhibits <i>vyāpāda,</i> ill-will or aversion. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are five kinds of <i>pīti:- </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. <i>Khuddaka pīti,</i> the thrill of joy that causes &quot;the flesh to 
	creep&quot;. </p>
    <p>2. <i>Khanika pīti,</i> instantaneous joy like a flash of lightning. </p>
    <p>3. <i>Okkantika pīti,</i> the flood of joy like the breakers on a 
	seashore. </p>
    <p>4. <i>Ubbega pīti,</i> transporting joy which enables one to float in the 
	air just as a lump of cotton carried by the wind. </p>
    <p>5. <i>Pharana pīti,</i> suffusing joy, which pervades the whole body like 
	a full blown bladder or like a flood that overflows small tanks and ponds. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>41. <b>Sukha</b> is bliss or happiness. It is a kind of pleasant feeling. It 
is opposed to <i>uddhacca</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> (restlessness and brooding). 
As <i>vitakka</i> is the precursor of <i>vicāra,</i> so is <i>pīti</i> the 
precursor of <i>sukha.</i>
</p>

<p>The enjoyment of the desired object is its characteristic. It is like a king 
that enjoys a delicious dish. </p>

<p><i>Pīti</i> creates an interest in the object, while <i>sukha</i>
enables one to enjoy the object. </p>

<p>Like the sight of an oasis to a weary traveler, is <i>pīti.</i> Like drinking 
water and bathing therein, is <i>sukha</i>. </p>

<p>This mental <i>sukha</i> which should be differentiated from <i>ahetuka 
kāyika</i> (physical) happiness is identical with <i>somanassa.</i> But it is a 
joy disconnected with material pleasures. This pleasurable feeling is the 
inevitable outcome of renouncing them <i>(nirāmisa sukha). </i>Nibbānic bliss is 
yet far more subtle than Jhānic bliss. There is no feeling in experiencing the 
bliss of Nibbāna. The total release from suffering<i> (dukkhūpasama) </i>is 
itself Nibbānic bliss. It is comparable to the &quot;ease&quot; of an invalid who is 
perfectly cured of a disease. It is a bliss of relief. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="42-Upekkha">42. <b>Upekkhā</b></a> - literally, means seeing <i>
(ikkhati) </i>impartially
<i>(upa = yuttito).</i> It is viewing an object with a balanced mind, 
Atthasālini states: - &quot;This is impartiality <i>(majjhattam)</i> in connection 
with the object, and implies a discriminative knowledge <i>(paricchindanakam 
ñānam)&quot;.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This explanation applies strictly to <i>upekkhā</i> found in <i>sobhana</i>
consciousness accompanied by wisdom. <i>Upekkhā</i> found in the <i>akusalas</i> 
and <i>ahetukas</i>
is just neutral feeling, without the least trace of any discriminative 
knowledge. In the <i>kāmāvacara sobhanas,</i> too, there may arise that neutral 
feeling, as in the case of one hearing the Dhamma without any pleasurable 
interest, and also a subtle form of <i>upekkhā</i> that views the object with 
deliberate impartiality and discriminative knowledge, as in the case of a wise 
person who hears the Dhamma with a critical and impartial mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> of the Jhāna consciousness, in particular is of ethical and 
psychological importance. It certainly is not the ordinary kind of <i>upekkhā,</i>
generally found in the <i>akusala</i> consciousness which comes naturally to an 
evil-doer. The Jhāna <i>upekkhā</i> has been developed by a strong will-power. 
Realizing that pleasurable feeling is also gross, the Yogi eliminates it as he 
did the other three Jhāna factors, and develops the more subtle and peaceful <i>
upekkhā.</i> On the attainment of the fifth Jhāna breathing ceases. As he has 
transcended both pain and pleasure by will-power, he is immune to pain too. </p>

<p>This <i>upekkhā</i> is a highly refined form of the ordinary <i>
tatramajjhattatā,</i>
even-mindedness, one of the moral mental states, latent in all types of <i>
sobhana</i>
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Pāli phrase - <i>upekkhā satipārisuddhi</i> - purity of mindfulness 
which comes of equanimity - it is the <i>tatra-majjhattatā</i> that is referred 
to. This is latent in the first four Jhānas too. In the fifth Jhāna this <i>
tatra-majjhattatā</i>
is singled out and becomes highly refined. Both neutral feeling <i>upekkhā 
vedanā)</i>
and equanimity that correspond to the one Pāli term <i>upekkhā</i> are found in 
the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus there appear to be four kinds of <i>upekkhā</i> viz:- (1) just neutral 
feeling, found in the six <i>akusala cittas,</i> (2) sensitive passive neutral 
feeling <i>(anubhavana upekkhā)</i> found in the eight <i>ahetuka</i> sense-door 
consciousness <i>(dvipañca-viññāna)</i><font SIZE="2"> (excluding <i>
kāyaviññāna)</i></font>, (3) intellectual <i>upekkhā,</i> found mostly in the 
two <i>sobhana kriyā cittas,</i>
accompanied by knowledge, and sometimes in the two <i>sobhana kusala cittas,</i>
accompanied by knowledge, (4) ethical <i>upekkhā,</i> found in all the <i>
sobhana cittas,</i>
especially in the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Brahmavihārupekkhā</i> and <i>sankhārupekkhā</i> may be included in both 
intellectual and ethical <i>upekkhā. </i></p>

<p>The first is equanimity amidst all vicissitudes of life. The second is 
neither attachment nor aversion with respect to all conditioned things. </p>

<p>Visuddhi-Magga enumerates ten kinds of <i>upekkhā.</i> See the Path of Purity 
-Vol. II pp. 184-186. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. <b>Ekaggatā</b> <i>(eka + agga + tā) </i>lit., one-pointedness. This is a 
mental state common to all Jhānas. By <i>sammā samādhi</i> (Right Concentration) 
is meant this <i>ekaggatā</i> found in the Path-consciousness. <i>Ekaggatā</i>
temporarily inhibits sensual desires. </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="page58"></a> 44. <b>Arūpa Jhāna</b>-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Yogi who has developed the <i>Rūpa</i> Jhānas and who wishes to develop 
the <i>Arūpa</i> Jhānas now concentrates on the Patibhāga Nimitta mentioned in 
the previous section. As he does so, a faint light, like a fire fly, issues from 
the Kasina object. He wills it to expand until it covers the whole space. Now he 
sees nothing but this light pervading everywhere. This developed space is not a 
reality but a mere concept. In Pāli this space is called <i>kasinugghātimākāsa</i> 
(space issuing forth from the Kasina object). On this concept he concentrates 
thinking &quot;<i>ākāso ananto</i>&quot;, &#39;Infinite is space&#39;, until he develops the first <i>
Arūpa</i> <i>Jhāna</i>-<i>ākāsānañcāyatana</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As in the case of the <i>Rūpa</i> Jhānas a thought-process, runs as follows:- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>mano-dvārāvajjana, parikamma, upacāra, anuloma, gotrabhū,</p>
    <p>ākāsānañcāyatana. </p>
    </i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Parikamma</i> thought-moment may or may not occur. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <i>Arūpa</i> Jhāna thought-moment occurs only for a moment, and then the 
consciousness lapses into <i>Bhavanga</i> consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again he concentrates on the first <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> thinking <i>&quot;viññānam 
anantam&quot;, </i>&#39;Infinite is Consciousness&#39; until he develops the second <i>Arūpa 
Jhāna</i> - <i>&quot;viññānañcāyatana&quot;. </p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To develop the third <i>Arūpa Jhāna - &quot;ākiñcaññāyatana&quot;</i> - the Yogi takes 
for his object the first <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness and thinks - <i>
&#39;Natthi kiñci&#39;,</i> &quot;There is nothing whatever&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fourth <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness is developed by taking the third <i>
Arūpa Jhāna</i> consciousness as the object. The third <i>Arūpa Jhāna</i>
is so subtle and refined that one cannot definitely say whether there is a 
consciousness or not. As he concentrates thus on the third consciousness he 
develops the fourth Jhāna. Although the term <i>&quot;saññā&quot;</i> is used here, <i>
vedanā, </i>(feeling) and <i>sankhārā,
</i>(mental states) are also included therein. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The five <i>Rūpa Jhānas</i> differ according to the Jhāna factors. These four <i>
Arūpa</i> <i>Jhānas,</i> on the other hand, differ according to the objects of 
concentration. The first and the third have two concepts <i>(paññatti). </i>They 
are the concept of the &#39;infinity of space&#39; and the concept of &#39;nothingness&#39;. The 
second and the fourth Jhāna consciousness have for their objects the first and 
the third Jhāna respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These four <i>Arūpa Jhānas</i> have their corresponding effects in the <i>
Arūpa</i> spheres. The four <i>Kriyā Jhānas</i> are experienced only by Buddhas 
and Arahats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all these twelve <i>Jhāna Cittas</i> are found the two Jhāna factors - <i>
Upekkhā</i> and <i>ekaggatā</i> - equanimity and one-pointedness that constitute 
the fifth <i>Rūpa Jhāna. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the four types of Supra mundane Moral and Resultant consciousness. 
Thus end, in all, the eight types of supra mundane Moral and Resultant 
consciousness. Differing according to the four Paths, the Moral Consciousness is 
fourfold. So are the Resultants, being their fruits. The Supra mundane should be 
understood as eightfold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus the &quot;Immorals&quot; are twelve, the &quot;Morals&quot; are twenty-one, the &quot;Resultants&quot; 
are thirty-six, the &quot;Functionals&quot; are twenty. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Sensuous Sphere, they say, are fifty-four types of consciousness, in 
the Form-Sphere are fifteen, in the Formless-Sphere are twelve, in the supra 
mundane are eight. </p>

<p>(121 Types of Consciousness)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 10. These different classes of consciousness, which thus number 
eighty-nine, the wise divide into one hundred and twenty-one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does consciousness which is analyzed into eighty-nine become one hundred 
and twenty-one? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The First <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with initial 
application, sustained application, joy, happiness, and one-pointedness,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. The Second <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with 
sustained application, joy, happiness, and one-pointedness, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. The Third <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with joy, 
happiness, and one-pointedness, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. The Fourth <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with 
happiness and one-pointedness, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. The Fifth <i>Jhāna Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness together with 
equanimity and one-pointedness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the five types of <i>Sotāpatti</i> Path-consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So are the Sakadāgāmī Path-consciousness, Anāgāmī Path-consciousness, and 
Arahatta Path-consciousness, making exactly twenty classes of consciousness. 
Similarly there are twenty classes of Fruit-consciousness. Thus there are forty 
types of supra mundane consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Dividing each (supra mundane) consciousness into five kinds according to 
different Jhāna factors, the supra mundane consciousness, it is said, becomes 
forty. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. As the Form-Sphere consciousness is treated as first Jhāna consciousness 
and so on, even so is the supra mundane consciousness. The Formless-Sphere 
consciousness is included in the fifth Jhāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Thus the Jhānas beginning from the first amount to eleven, they say. The 
last Jhāna (i.e., the fifth ) totals twenty-three. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Thirty-seven are Morals, fifty-two are Resultants; thus the wise say that 
there are one-hundred and twenty-one types of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus ends the first chapter of the Abhidhammattha Sangaha which deals with 
the Analysis of the Consciousness </p>

<a name='6-15' href='?#6-15'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<p>45. <b>The Realization of Nibbāna.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Yogi who wishes to realize Nibbāna tries to understand things as they 
truly are. With his one-pointed mind he scrutinizes his self and, on due 
examination, discovers that his so-called &quot;Ego-personality&quot; is nothing but a 
mere composition of mind and matter - the former consisting of fleeting mental 
states that arise as a result of the senses coming into contact with the 
sense-stimuli, and the latter of forces and qualities that manifest them-selves 
in multifarious phenomena. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of his self, freed from 
the false notion of an identical substance of mind and matter, he attempts to 
investigate the cause of this &quot;Ego-personality.&quot; He realizes that everything 
worldly, himself not excluded, is conditioned by causes past or present, and 
that this existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>
(tanhā),</i> attachment <i>(upādāna),</i>
Kamma, and physical food <i>(āhāra)</i> of the present life. On account of these 
five causes this personality has arisen and as the past activities have 
conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. Meditating 
thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to the past, present, and future <i>
(kankhā-vitarana-visuddhi).</i>
Thereupon he contemplates that all conditioned things are transient <i>(anicca),</i>
subject to suffering <i>(dukkha), </i>and devoid of an immortal soul <i>
(anattā).</i>
Wherever he turns his eyes, he sees nothing but these three characteristics 
standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a mere flowing, continuous 
undivided movement. Neither in a celestial plane nor on earth does he find any 
genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to pain. What is 
transient is therefore subject to suffering and where change and sorrow prevail 
there cannot be a permanent ego. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As he is thus absorbed in meditation, a day comes when, to his surprise, he 
witnesses an aura emanating from his body <i>(obhāsa). </i>He experiences an 
unprecedented pleasure, happiness, and quietude. He becomes evenminded and 
strenuous. His religious fervour increases, and mindfulness becomes perfect, and 
Insight extraordinarily keen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress for Sainthood, chiefly owing 
to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking for this mental state. Soon 
the realization comes that these new developments are only obstacles to moral 
progress and he cultivates the &#39;purity of Knowledge&#39; with regard to the &#39;Path&#39; 
and &#39;Non-path&#39; <i>(maggāmagga-ñānadassana visuddhi). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of conditioned things. Of these 
two characteristics the latter becomes more impressed in his mind, because 
change is more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he turns his attention to 
the contemplation of the dissolution of things <i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He 
perceives that both mind and matter, which constitute his personality, are in a 
state of constant flux, not remaining for two consecutive moments the same. To 
him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving things are fearful <i>(bhaya 
ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a pit of burning embers, a source 
of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava 
ñāna)</i> of the fearful world and feeling disgusted with it <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i>
wishes to escape therefrom <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this object in view, he meditates again on the three characteristics <i>
(patisankhā ñāna),</i> and thereafter becomes completely indifferent to all 
conditioned things - having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly 
object <i>(sankhārupekkhā ñāna). </i>Reaching this point of mental culture, he 
takes for his object of special endeavour one of the three characteristics that 
appeals to him most, and intently keeps on developing insight in that particular 
direction, until that glorious day when, for the first time, he realizes 
Nibbāna, his ultimate goal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <i>Javana</i> thought-process then runs as follows:</p>

<table border="1" width="58%">
  <tr>
    <td width="16%">
    <p>1</td>
    <td width="16%">
    <p>2</td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p>3</td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p>4</td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p>&nbsp; 5</td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p>6,7 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="16%">
    <p><i>Parikamma</i></td>
    <td width="16%">
    <p><i>Upacāra</i></td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p><i>Anuloma</i></td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p><i>Gotrabhū</i></td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p><i>Magga</i></td>
    <td width="17%">
    <p><i>Phala</i></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When there is no <i>Parikamma</i> thought-moment, in the case of an 
individual with keen Insight, there arise three <i>Phala</i> thought-moments. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These nine kinds of Insight, viz:- <i>Udaya, Vaya, Bhanga, Bhaya, ādīnava, 
Nibbidā, Muñcitukamyatā, Patisankhā, Sankhārupekkhā </i>and <i>Anuloma ñāna</i> 
are collectively called <i>&quot;Patipadā ñānadassana Visuddhi&quot; </i>- Purity of 
Knowledge and Vision as regards the Practice. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insight found in this Supra mundane Path - Consciousness is known as <i>
Ñānadassana Visuddhi </i>- Purity of Knowledge and Vision. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time, he is called 
a Sotāpanna - One who has entered the Stream that leads to Nibbāna for the first 
time. He is no more a <a NAME="page68">worldling</a> <i>(puthujjana)</i> but an 
Ariya. He eliminates three Fetters - namely, Self-illusion <i>(sakkāya ditthi),</i> 
Doubts <i>(vicikicchā),</i>
and Adherence to Wrongful Rites and Ceremonies <i>(sīlabbata parāmāsa). </i>As 
he has, not eradicated all the Fetters that bind him to existence, he is reborn 
seven times at the most. In his subsequent birth he may or may not be aware of 
the fact that he is a Sotāpanna. Nevertheless, he possesses the characteristics 
peculiar to such a Saint. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Sangha, and would 
never violate any of the five Precepts. He is moreover absolved from states of 
woe, for he is destined to Enlightenment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summoning up fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, 
the Aryan pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight becomes a 
Sakadāgāmī. (Once-Returner), by attenuating two other Fetters -namely, 
Sense-desire<i>
(kāmarāga) </i>and Ill-will <i>(patigha). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, too, and in the case of the other two advanced stages of 
Sainthood, a <i>javana</i> thought-process runs as above, but the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is termed <i>&quot;vodāna&quot;</i> (pure) as the individual is purified. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Sakadāgāmī is reborn on earth only once in case he does not attain 
Arahatship in that life itself. It is interesting to note that the pilgrim who 
has attained the second stage of Sainthood can only weaken these two powerful 
fetters with which he is bound from a beginningless past. Occasionally he may be 
disturbed by thoughts of lust and anger to a slight extent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is by attaining the third stage of Sainthood, Anāgāmī (State of a 
Never-Returner), that he completely discards the above two Fetters. Thereafter 
he neither returns to this world nor does he seek birth in celestial realms, 
since he has rooted out the desire for sensual pleasures. After death he is 
reborn in the &quot;Pure Abodes&quot; <i>(suddhāvāsa)</i>
environment reserved for Anāgāmīs and Arahats. There he attains Arahatship and 
lives till the end of his life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the earnest pilgrim, encouraged by the unprecedented success of his 
endeavours, makes his final advance and destroying the remaining five Fetters - 
namely, Attachment to Form-sphere <i>(rūparāga), </i>Attachment to Formless 
Sphere <i>(arūpa rāga),</i> Conceit <i>(māna),</i> Restlessness <i>(uddhacca),</i> 
and Ignorance <i>(avijjā),
</i>attains Arahatship, the final stage of Sainthood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be noted that the Fetters have to be eradicated in four stages. The 
Path <i>(magga) </i>thought-moment occurs only once. The Fruit <i>(phala)</i> 
thought moment immediately follows. In the Supra mundane classes of 
consciousness the effect of the <i>kusala cittas</i> is instantaneous. Hence it 
is called <i>akālika</i> (of immediate fruit); whereas in the case of <i>lokiya 
cittas</i> effects may take place in this life, or in a subsequent life, or at 
any time till one attains Parinibbāna.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Mundane consciousness Kamma is predominant, while in the Supra mundane <i>
paññā</i> or wisdom is predominant. Hence the four <i>kusala lokuttara</i> <i>
cittas</i>
are not treated as Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These eight <i>cittas</i> are called <i>lokuttara</i>. Here Loka means the <i>
Pañcupādana-kkhandha</i>, the five Aggregates of Attachment. <i>Uttara</i> means 
that which transcends. <i>Lokuttara</i> therefore means that which transcends 
the world of Aggregates of Attachment. This definition strictly applies to the 
Four Paths. The Fruits are called <i>Lokuttara</i> because they have transcended 
the world of Aggregates of Attachment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. <b>Forty Types of Lokuttara Cittas:</b>- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One who has attained the First Jhāna emerges from it and meditates on the 
impermanence, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of those mental states in that 
particular consciousness and ultimately realizes Nibbāna. As the First Jhāna was 
made the basis to realize Nibbāna this <i>lokuttara kusala</i> thought is 
called- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><p>Vitakka-Vicāra-Pīti-Sukh&#39;Ekaggatā-sahitam 
	  Pathamajjhāna-Sotāpattimagga-cittam. </p>
    </i>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This <i>magga</i> thought-moment is immediately followed by the <i>phala</i>
thought-moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same manner the other four Jhānas are made the bases to realize 
Nibbāna. Now, for each stage there are five Paths and five Fruits according to 
the different Jhānas. For the four stages there are forty classes of 
consciousness. </p>

<p><font FACE="Arial"><u><b>CHAPTER II - Mental States (c<i>etasika)</i></b></u></font></p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p>In the 89 types of consciousness, enumerated in the first chapter, 52 mental 
states arise in varying degree. </p>

<p>There are 7 concomitants common to every consciousness. There are 6 others 
that may or may not arise in each and every consciousness. They are termed <i>
Pakinnakā</i>
(Particulars). </p>

<p>All these 13 are designated <i>aññasamāna,</i> a rather peculiar technical 
term. <i>Añña</i> means &#39;other&#39;, <i>samana</i> means &#39;common&#39;. <i>Sobhanas,</i>
(Good), when compared with <i>asobhanas</i> (Evil,) are called <i>añña</i> - 
&#39;other&#39;, being of the opposite category. So are the <i>asobhanas</i> in 
contradistinction to <i>Sobhanas</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These 13 become moral or immoral according to the type of consciousness in 
which they occur. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>14 concomitants are variably found in every type of immoral 
	consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>19 are common to all types of moral consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 other moral concomitants occur as occasion arises. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus these fifty-two (7 + 6 + 14 + 19 + 6 = 52) are found in the respective 
types of consciousness in different proportions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this chapter all the 52 mental states are enumerated and classified. Every 
type of consciousness is microscopically analyzed, and the accompanying mental 
states are given in detail. The type of consciousness in which each mental state 
occurs, is also described. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To an impatient lay reader this chapter will appear rather dry and 
uninteresting. To a critical and intelligent reader it will, on the contrary, 
serve as an intellectual treat. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the outset, for instance, a student of chemistry may find the numerous 
chemical formulas somewhat perplexing. But he finds the subject interesting and 
edifying, when he seriously attempts to analyze and examine the various 
substances with different tests. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In like manner a student of Abhidhamma who reads this chapter should first 
try to analyze and examine care fully every type of consciousness and see for 
himself the mental states thereof according to his own reasoning. Later, he 
should compare his results with the original text. He will then find this 
chapter most illuminating, and instead of wasting time in memorizing numbers, he 
will intelligently grasp the meaning of the text. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, let us analyze the first immoral type of consciousness, rooted 
in attachment. </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><i>Somanassa-sahagata -</i> Accompanied by pleasure,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><i>Ditthigata-sampayutta -</i> Connected with misbelief,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><i>Asankhārika -</i> Unprompted. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>This consciousness, when analyzed, will show that the <i>vedanā</i> or 
feeling is pleasure&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 7 Universals and all the Particulars are found in it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 4 Immoral mental states common to all immorals such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p> <i>moha</i>
(delusion), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>ahirika</i> (shamelessness), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>anottappa,</i> (fearlessness),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>uddhacca</i> (restlessness) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>must arise in it. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the remaining ten? </p>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Lobha</i> - attachment must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Ditthi</i> - misbelief must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Māna</i> - conceit cannot arise. </dt>
    </div>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conceit does not arise in <i>lobha</i> consciousness, together with 
misbelief. <i>Ditthi</i> is connected with wrong view, while <i>māna</i> is 
concerned with egoism. Both of them, say the commentators, are like two lions 
that cannot live together in one cave. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><i>Dosa</i> (hatred), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>issā</i> (envy), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>macchariya</i> (avarice),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>kukkucca</i> (brooding) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>cannot arise, because these four are akin to aversion. They are found only in 
hateful consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> - (sloth and torpor) do not arise because this 
is an unprompted consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No <i>sobhanas</i> - (beautiful) occur in an immoral consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total - 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, on analysis, we see that the first immoral consciousness consists of 19 
mental states. </p>

<p>The other types of consciousness should be similarly analyzed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. The fifty-two states that are associated with consciousness, that arise 
and perish together with consciousness, that have the same object and basis as 
consciousness, are known as <i>cetasikas</i> (mental states).</p>

<a name='9-1' href='?#9-1'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes:- </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Cetasika</b> = <i>Ceta + s + ika</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That which is associated with mind or consciousness is <i>cetasika</i>. 
(Sanskrit - <i>caitasika</i> or <i>caitti). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Definition-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Cetasika</i> is</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>(i) that which arises together with consciousness,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>(ii) that which perishes together with it,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>(iii) that which has an identical object with it,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>(iv) that which has a common basis with it. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Readers will note that the author has not given here a logical definition 
according to genus and species. Instead he speaks of four characteristic 
properties of a <i>cetasika.</i> The Commentator cites reasons for attributing 
these four properties. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No consciousness exists apart from its concomitants. Both consciousness and 
its respective co-adjuncts arise and perish simultaneously. But there are some 
material qualities such as <i>viññatti rūpa*</i> (Modes of Intimation) - that 
arise and perish simultaneously with the consciousness. To exclude them the 
third property of having a common object has been attributed. That which 
possesses these three characteristics must necessarily be endowed with the 
fourth - a common basis. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>*[ <i>Kāyaviññatti</i> (mode of action) and <i>Vaci Viññatti</i> (mode of 
speech)]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma, mind or consciousness is accompanied by fifty-two 
mental states <i>(cetasikas). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of them is <i>vedanā</i> (feeling); another is <i>saññā</i>
(perception). The remaining fifty are collectively called <i>sankhārā.</i> <i>
Cetanā</i>
(volition) is the most important of them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole group of feelings is called <i>vedanā-kkhandha.</i> So are <i>
saññā-kkhandha</i>
and <i>sankhāra-kkhandha</i>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Phassa</b>- Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>phas,</i>
to contact.</p>

<p>For any sense-impression to occur, three things are essential - namely, 
consciousness, respective sense and the object. For instance, one sees an object 
with the consciousness through the eye as its instrument. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When an object presents itself to the consciousness through one of the six 
senses there arises the mental state-contact. &quot;It should not be understood that 
mere collision is contact<i> (Na sangatimatto eva Phasso). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like a pillar which acts as a strong support to the rest of the structure, 
even so is contact to the coexistent mental concomitants. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Contact means &#39;it touches&#39; <i>(phusatī&#39;ti).</i> It has touching <i>(phusana)</i>
as its salient characteristic <i>(lakkhana), </i>impact <i>(sanghattana)</i> as 
its function <i>(rasa), </i>coinciding (of the physical basis, object and 
consciousness) as its manifestation <i>(sannipāta paccupatthāna),</i> and the 
object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause <i>
(padatthāna).&quot;</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contact is mentioned first because it precedes all other mental states. 
&quot;Touching by contact, consciousness experiences by feeling, perceives by 
perception, wills by volition - <i>(Phassena phusitvā, vedanāya vediyati, 
saññāya sañjānāti, cetanāya ceteti)&quot;.</i> According to <i>Paticca-Samuppāda,</i> 
too, Contact conditions Feeling. But strictly speaking, there is no reason for 
the sequence because all these mental states are coexistent. The Atthasālini 
states - &quot;For of states, arisen in one conscious moment, it is not valid to say 
that &#39;this&#39; arises first, &#39;that&#39; afterwards. The reason is not because contact 
is a strong support. Contact is just mentioned first in the order of teaching, 
but it was also permissible to bring it in thus: - There are feeling and 
contact, perception and contact, volition and contact; there are consciousness 
and contact, feeling, perception, volition, initial application of mind. In the 
order of teaching, however, contact is mentioned first. Nor is the sequence of 
words among the remaining states of any special significance.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Contact is given priority of place, as standing for the inception of the 
thought, and as the sine qua non of all the allied states, conditioning them 
much as the roof-tree of a storeyed house supports all the other combinations of 
material.&quot; </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Mrs. Rhys Davids - Buddhist Psychology, p. 6.) </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Vedanā</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vid,</i>
to experience. </p>

<p>Feeling is a more appropriate rendering for <i>vedanā</i> than sensation. 
Like contact, feeling is an essential property of every consciousness. It may be 
pleasurable painful, or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. But 
physical feeling is not of ethical importance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the commentators feeling is like a master who enjoys a dish 
prepared by a cook. The latter is compared to the remaining mental states that 
constitute a thought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that experiences 
an object when it comes in contact with the senses. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this feeling that experiences the desirable or undesirable fruits of an 
action done in this or in a previous birth. Besides this mental state there is 
no soul or any other agent to experience the result of the action. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be understood here that Nibbānic bliss is not connected with 
feeling. Nibbānic bliss is certainly the highest happiness <i>(sukha),</i> but 
it is the happiness of relief from suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a 
pleasurable object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Saññā</b> - <i>Sam</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i>
to know, (Compare Latin cognoscere, to know.)</p>

<p>The meaning of this term widely varies according to the context. To avoid 
unnecessary confusion, it is best to understand the specific meaning used in the 
particular connection as a universal mental state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>saññā</i> is the cognition of an object by way 
of a mark as blue etc. It is <i>saññā</i> that enables one to recognize an 
object that has once been perceived by the mind through the senses. &quot;Its 
procedure is likened to the carpenter&#39;s recognition of certain kinds of wood by 
the mark he had made on each; to the treasurer&#39;s specifying certain articles of 
jewelry by the ticket on each; to the wild animal&#39;s discernment in the scarecrow 
of the work of man.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Saññā,</i> therefore, means simple sense perception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Perception,&quot; according to a modern Dictionary of Philosophy, &quot;is the 
apprehension of ordinary sense-objects, such as trees, houses, chairs, etc., on 
the occasion of sensory stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perception is not used here in the sense employed by early modern 
philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As one of the five <i>khandhas</i> (Aggregates) <i>saññā</i> is used in the 
sense of perception. </p>

<p>Could it be that memory is due to this <i>saññā? </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Saññā, viññāna</i> and <i>paññā</i> should be differentiated from one 
another. <i>Saññā</i> is like the mere perception of a rupee coin by a child. By 
its whiteness, roundness and size it merely recognizes the coin as a rupee, 
utterly ignorant of its monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its value 
and its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition. <i>Viññāna</i> is 
comparable to the ordinary man&#39;s knowledge of the rupee. <i>Paññā</i> is like 
the analytical knowledge of a chemist who knows all its chemical properties in 
every detail. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Cetanā</b> - </p>

<p>Both <i>cetanā</i> and <i>citta</i> are derived from the same root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>cit,</i> to think. </p>

<p>In the case of <i>citta</i> - mind or consciousness - the root assumes the 
meaning of discernment <i>(vijānana),</i> while in <i>cetanā</i> it is used in 
the sense of co-ordination <i>(abhisandhāna) </i>and accumulation <i>(āyūhana).</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Atthasālini and Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>cetanā</i> is that which 
co-ordinates the mental states associated with itself on the object of 
consciousness. <i>(Attanā sampayutta-dhamme ārammane abhisandahati). </i>Like a 
chief disciple, or like a carpenter who fulfills his duties and regulates the 
work of others as well, so does <i>cetanā</i> fulfill its own function and 
regulate the function of other concomitants associated with itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A further explanation has been offered. <i>Cetanā</i> is that which arrives 
at action in conditioning the conditioned. <i>(Sankhatābhisankharane va byāpāram 
āpajjatī&#39;ti cetanā).</i> <i>Cetanā</i> is that which plays a predominant part in 
all actions, moral and immoral.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shwe Zan Aung says that according to Ledi Sayadaw, the Burmese Abhidhamma 
scholar, &quot;Cetanā acts on its concomitants, acts in getting the object, and acts 
on accomplishing the task, i.e., determines action.&quot; (Compendium, p. 236).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most significant mental state in the Mundane Consciousness <i>(lokiya)</i>
is this <i>cetanā,</i> while in the Supra mundane it is <i>paññā,</i> wisdom or 
insight. Mundane thoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supra mundane thoughts, on 
the contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma. Hence <i>cetanā</i> in the supra mundane 
consciousness does not constitute Kamma. <i>Cetanā</i> in every moral and 
immoral type of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, is regarded as Kamma. 
Although <i>Cetanā</i> is found in <i>Vipāka</i> types of consciousness too, it 
is of no moral significance as it lacks accumulative power. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this <i>cetanā</i> that is alluded to as <i>sankhāra</i> and (Kamma) <i>
bhava</i> in the <i>Paticca Samuppāda.</i> In the <i>pañcakkhandha,</i> by <i>
sankhārakkhandha</i>
are meant the fifty mental states, excluding <i>vedanā</i> and <i>saññā,</i> 
with <i>cetanā</i>
as the foremost. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From a psychological standpoint <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of 
the mental states associated with it. From an ethical standpoint, it determines 
its inevitable consequences. Hence where there is no <i>cetanā,</i> there is no 
Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Ekaggatā</b> - </p>

<p><i>Eka + agga + tā</i> = one-pointedness, or concentration on one object, or 
focusing the mind on one object. It is like a steady lamp-flame in a windless 
place. It is like a firmly fixed pillar that cannot be shaken by the wind. It is 
like water that binds together several substances to form one concrete compound. 
This mental state prevents its adjuncts from dissipation and fixes them on one 
object. </p>

<p>This one-pointedness is one of the five Jhāna factors. When it is developed 
and cultivated it is designated <i>samādhi.</i> &quot;It is the germ of all 
attentive, selected, focused, or concentrated consciousness.&quot; (Compendium, p. 
241). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Jīvitindriya</b> - </p>

<p><i>Jīvita</i> = life; + <i>indriya</i> = controlling faculty or principle. </p>

<p>It is called <i>jīvita</i> because it sustains its co-associates. </p>

<p>It is called <i>indriya</i> because it controls its co-associates. </p>

<p>Although <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of all mental states, it is <i>
jīvitindriya</i> that infuses life into <i>cetanā</i> and other concomitants. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Jīvitindriya</i> is twofold - namely, psychic life <i>(nāma-jīvitindriya)</i>
and physical life <i>(rūpa-jīvitindriya).</i> Mental States are vitalized by 
psychic life, while material phenomena are vitalized by physical life. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As lotuses are sustained by water, an infant is sustained by a nurse, so are 
mental states and material phenomena sustained by <i>jīvitindriya. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> lasts for seventeen thought moments. Seventeen <i>
nāma-jīvitindriya</i> arise and perish during the brief life of one <i>
rūpa-jīvitindriya.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a certain kind of <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> in plant life. But, <i>
rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> in men and animals is differentiated from that which 
exists in plants because the former is conditioned by past Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i> and <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> arise at the 
moment of conception. They simultaneously perish at the moment of decease. Hence 
death is regarded as the perishing of this <i>jīvitindriya.</i> Immediately 
after, due to the power of Kamma, another <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i> arises in the 
subsequent birth at the moment of conception. Simultaneous with the arising of 
the one <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i>
there arise three <i>rūpa-jīvitindriyas</i> in the case of a human being.* </p>

<p>Just as a boatman depends on the boat and the boat depends on the boatman, 
even so <i>jīvitindriya</i> depends on mind and matter, and mind and matter 
depend on <i>jīvitindriya. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>*[They are the <i>Rūpa-Jīvtindriyas</i> of tho &#39;body decad&#39; <i>(kāyadasaka)</i>
&#39;sex-decad&#39; <i>(bhāvadasaka)</i> and &#39;seat-decad&#39;<i> (vatthudasaka).</i> See ch. 
VI.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Manasikāra</b> - </p>

<p>The literal meaning of the term is &#39;making in the mind&#39;. </p>

<p>Turning the mind towards the object is the chief characteristic of <i>
manasikāra.</i>
It is like the rudder of a ship, which is indispensable to take her directly to 
her destination. Mind without <i>manasikāra</i> is like a rudderless ship. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Manasikāra</i> is also compared to a charioteer that sits with close 
attention on two well-trained horses (mind and object) as regards their 
rhythmical movements. <i>Manasikāra</i> should be distinguished from <i>vitakka</i> 
which is to follow. The former directs its concomitants to the object, while the 
latter applies or throws <i>(pakkhipanto viya) </i>them on the object. <i>
Vitakka</i> is like a favorite courtier that introduces a villager (mind) into 
the presence of a king (object). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attention is the closest equivalent to <i>manasikāra,</i> although the Pāli 
term does not fully connote the meaning attached to the English word from a 
strictly philosophical standpoint. As a mental state it is mere spontaneous 
attention. In <i>manasikāra,</i>
as in attention, there is no peculiar vividness or clarity. To <i>saññā</i> may 
be attributed this vividness to some extent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could <i>manasikāra</i> also be an aid to memory, as it is common to all 
types of consciousness, whether mundane or supra mundane? Hence they are 
designated <i>Sabbacitta-sādhāranā.
</p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Vitakka</b> - </p>

<p><i>Vi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>takk,</i> to think. </p>

<p>It is difficult to suggest a suitable rendering for this Pāli term which 
assumes different meanings in the Suttas and Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Sutta Pitaka it has been employed in the sense of notions, ideas, 
thoughts, reasoning etc. In the Abhidhamma it is used in a specific technical 
sense. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#39;Lifting&#39; of the concomitants to the object <i>(abhiniropana)</i> is its 
chief characteristic. As someone ascends to the king&#39;s palace depending on a 
king&#39;s favorite, relative or friend, likewise consciousness ascends to the 
object depending on <i>vitakka</i>
(Atthasālini, p. 114). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Vitakka</i> may well be defined as the application of the concomitants on 
the object. <i>Manasikāra,</i> as stated above, is the directing of the 
concomitants to the object. The distinguishing characteristics of these two <i>
cetasikas</i>
should be clearly understood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different values are attached to <i>vitakka</i> when it is used in different 
connections. </p>

<p>As an ordinary particular <i>(pakinnakā)</i> mental state it is simply called <i>
vitakka.</i> When it is developed and cultivated it becomes the foremost factor 
of the First Jhāna. Then it is termed <i>appanā</i> because the mind is 
steadfastly fixed on the object. The ordinary <i>vitakka</i> simply throws the 
mind to the surface of the object. </p>

<p>In the subsequent Jhānas <i>vitakka</i> is, however, inhibited, owing to the 
habitual association with the object. </p>

<p>A villager, for instance, who visits the king&#39;s palace for the first time, 
needs the introduction of a favorite courtier. For his subsequent visits no such 
introduction is necessary as he is acquainted with the place. </p>

<p>It is this developed <i>appanā-vitakka</i> that is known as <i>samādhi</i>
or concentration. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When <i>vitakka</i> is present in the Supra mundane Path Consciousness <i>
(lokuttara magga citta) </i>it is termed <i>sammā sankappa</i> (Right Thoughts) 
because it eliminates wrong thoughts and applies the mind to Nibbāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Vitakka</i> is used in entirely a different sense when used in connection 
with the temperaments of individuals. <i>Vitakka carita</i> means one of a 
discursive temperament. (See Ch. 1. note 38.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Vicāra</b> - </p>

<p><i>Vi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>car,</i> to wander. </p>

<p>Like <i>vitakka, vicāra</i> too is employed in a technical sense in 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p><i>Vicāra</i> is the continued exercise of the mind on the object. </p>

<p>Examination <i>(anumajjana)</i> is its chief characteristic. </p>

<p>So far the renderings for <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> are initial and 
sustained application respectively. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both terms should be distinguished. Like a bee alighting on a lotus is <i>
vitakka,</i>
like its gyrating around the lotus is <i>vicāra.</i> Like the flapping of a bird 
about to fly is <i>vitakka,</i> like its planning movements in the sky is <i>
vicāra.</i> Like the beating of a drum or bell is <i>vitakka,</i> like its 
reverberation is <i>vicāra. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Vicāra</i> is also a Jhāna factor. It inhibits <i>vicikicchā</i>
(Doubt or Indecision). (See Ch. 1. note 39.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Adhimokkha</b> - </p>

<p><i>Adhi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muc,</i> to release. Literally, 
the term means &#39;release-on-to&#39; . </p>

<p><i>Adhimokkha</i> releases the mind on to the object. Its chief 
characteristic is decision or choosing, and is opposed to <i>vicikicchā</i> - 
doubt or indecision. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It makes the decision - &#39;Just this one&#39;. <i>(imam&#39; evā&#39;ti 
sannitthānakaranam). </i></p>

<p>It is compared to a judge that decides a case. It is also compared to a 
steady pillar owing to its unwavering state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Viriya</b> - </p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>aj,</i> to go + <i>īr.</i>
<i>Vī</i> is substituted for <i>aj. Vīra</i> is one who strenuously carries on 
his work uninterruptedly. </p>

<p>It is defined as the state or action of energetic persons <i>(Vīrānam bhāvo, 
kammam).</i> Or, it is that which is effected or carried out methodically <i>
(Vidhinā īrayitabbam pavattetabbam vā). </i></p>

<p>It has the characteristic of supporting <i>(upatthambana</i> upholding <i>
(paggahana),
</i>sustaining <i>(ussahana). </i></p>

<p>As an old house is supported by new pillars even so concomitants are aided 
and supported by Viriya.</p>

<p>Just as a strong reinforcement would help an army to hold on instead of 
retreating, even so<i> viriya</i> upholds or uplifts its concomitants. </p>

<p><i>Viriya</i> is regarded as a controlling factor <i>(indriya)</i>
because it overcomes idleness. It is also regarded as one of the five powers <i>
(bala)</i>
because it cannot be shaken by its opposite idleness. <i>Viriya</i> serves as 
one of the four means of accomplishing one&#39;s ends <i>(iddhi-pāda).</i> It is 
this <i>viriya</i> that appears as Four Modes of Supreme Efforts <i>
(samma-ppadhāna). Viriya</i> is sublimated as one of the seven factors of 
Enlightenment <i>(bojjhanga).</i> Finally it has been elevated to one of the 
eight members of the Noble Path <i>(atthangika-magga)</i> as <i>sammā vāyāma</i> 
(Right-Effort).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atthasālini states that <i>viriya</i> should be regarded as the root of all 
achievements. </p>

<p>Effort, exertion, energy are suggested as best equivalents. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Pīti</b> - See Ch. 1. note 40. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Chanda</b> - </p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>chad,</i> to wish. </p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>chanda</i> is the wish-to-do <i>
(kattu-kamyatā).
</i>It is like the stretching of the hand to grasp an object. </p>

<p>This unmoral <i>chanda</i> should be distinguished from immoral <i>lobha</i>
which is clinging to an object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three kinds of <i>chanda</i> namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <p>(i) <i>kāma-cchanda</i> which is sensual craving, one of the Five 
		Hindrances <i>(nīvarana).</i> This is ethically immoral. </p>
        </li>
    <li>
        <p>(ii) <i>kattu-kamyatā</i> <i>chanda</i>, the mere wish-to-do. This is 
		ethically unmoral. </p>
        </li>
    <li>
        <p>(iii) <i>dhammacchanda,</i> righteous wish. It is this <i>
		dhammacchanda</i>
        that impelled Prince Siddhartha to renounce Royal pleasures. </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Of them it is <i>kattu-kamyatā</i> <i>chanda</i>, meaning attached to this 
particular mental state, that serves as one of the four dominant influences <i>
(adhipati).
</i></p>

<p>Shwe Zan Aung says - &quot;The effort of conation or will is due to <i>viriya. 
Pīti</i> signifies an interest in the object; <i>chanda</i> constitutes the 
intention with respect to object.&#39; (Compendium p. 18). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buddhists have this <i>dhammacchanda</i> for the realization of Nibbāna. It 
is not a kind of craving. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Moha</b> - </p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muh,</i> to be stupefied, to be 
deluded. <i>Moha</i> is one of the three roots of evil and is common to all 
immoral types of consciousness. It is opposed to <i>paññā</i> - wisdom. </p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>moha</i> is confusion with regard to the 
nature of an object. <i>Moha</i> clouds one&#39;s knowledge with regard to Kamma and 
its consequences and the four Noble Truths. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Ahirika</b> - </p>

<p>An abstract noun formed of <i>&quot;a&quot; + hirika. </i></p>

<p>He who is not ashamed of doing evil is <i>ahiriko. </i>The state of such a 
person is <i>ahirikkam = ahirikam. </i></p>

<p>One who has <i>hiri</i> recoils from evil just as a cock&#39;s feather shrinks in 
front of fire. One who has no <i>hiri,</i> would commit any evil without the 
least compunction. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Anottappa</b> - </p>

<p><i>Na + ava +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>tapp,</i> to be tormented. </p>

<p><i>Ottappa</i> is fear to do evil, i.e., fear of the Consequences. </p>

<p><i>Anottappa</i> is its opposite and is compared to a moth that is singed by 
fire. A person who is afraid of fire would not touch it, but a moth, unaware of 
the consequences, attracted by fire, would get burnt. In the same way a person 
without <i>ottappa</i>
would commit evil and suffer in states of woe. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both these terms - <i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> - are found in conjunction. <i>
Hiri</i> should be differentiated from ordinary shyness and <i>ottappa</i>
from ordinary fear of any individual. Fear is regarded as one of the ten armies 
of Māra. A Buddhist is not expected to be afraid of any individual, even a God, 
for Buddhism is not based on the fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Hiri</i> arises from within, and <i>ottappa</i> from without. Suppose, for 
instance, there is a piece of iron, one end of which is heated, and the other 
smeared with filth. The filthy end one would not touch owing to disgust, and the 
other end through fear. Hiri is compared to the former and <i>ottappa</i> to the 
latter. </p>

<p>The following note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on <i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i>
clearly depicts the difference between these relative mental constituents:- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa,</i> as analyzed by Buddhaghosa present points of 
considerable ethical interest. Taken together they give us the emotional and 
conative aspect of the modern notion of conscience, just as <i>sati</i> 
represents its intellectual side. The former term &#39;is equivalent to shame <i>
(lajjā),&#39; </i>the latter to &#39;anguish <i>(ubbego) </i>over evildoing.&#39; <i>Hiri</i> 
has its source within; <i>ottappa</i>
spring from without. <i>Hiri</i> is autonomous <i>(attādhipati); ottappa,</i>
heteronomous, influenced by society <i>(lokādhipati). </i>The former is 
established on shame; the latter on dread. The former is marked by consistency; 
the latter by discernment of the danger and fearsomeness of error. The 
subjective source of <i>hiri</i> is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to 
one&#39;s birth, age, worth, and education. Thus, one having <i>hiri</i>
will think &#39;Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poor wretches, the blind and 
ignorant, would do such an act,&#39; and refrains. The external source of <i>ottappa</i> 
is, the idea that &#39;the body of the faithful will blame you,&#39; and hence one 
refrains. If a man has <i>hiri,</i>
he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To one who is sensitive by way 
of <i>ottappa,</i>
the masters of the faith are the best guides.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a supplementary paragraph the &#39;marks&#39; (consistency etc.) are thus 
explained: &#39;In <i>hiri</i> one reflects on the worth of one&#39;s birth, one&#39;s 
teacher, one&#39;s estate, and one&#39;s fellow students. In <i>ottappa</i> one feels 
dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribution in 
another life.&quot; </p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, p. 20). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> are regarded as the two dominant factors that 
rule the world. No civilized society can exist without them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Uddhacca</b> -</p>

<p><i>U</i> = up, above, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>Dhu,</i> to waver, to 
shake off. </p>

<p><i>Uddhutassa bhāvo Uddhuccam = Uddhaccam</i> - state of throwing up. It is 
compared to the disturbed state of a heap of ashes when hit with a stone. It is 
the unsettled state of mind, and is opposed to collectedness <i>(vupasama). </i>
As one of the five Hindrances it is the antithesis of <i>sukha,</i> happiness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some rare instances <i>uddhacca</i> is used in the sense of puffed-up 
state of mind, corresponding to conceit. Here it is not used in that sense. As a 
rule <i>uddhacca</i> is differentiated from <i>māna</i> because both of them are 
treated as <i>samyojanas</i> (Fetters). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These four, viz., <i>moha, ahirika, anottappa, uddhacca</i> - that head the 
list of Immoral <i>cetasikas</i> - are common to all Immoral types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>Lobha</b> - See Ch. 1, note 9. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Ditthi.</b> - See Ch. 1, note 11. </p>

<p>The difference between <i>moha</i> and <i>ditthi</i> should be noted. The 
former clouds the object; the latter deals with one&#39;s views, such as &quot;this 
indeed is truth, and the rest is false&quot;. <i>Ditthi</i> is opposed to <i>ñāna,</i> 
wisdom. The former rejects the real nature and views wrongly. The latter 
discerns the object as it is. </p>

<p>When the Pāli term <i>ditthi</i> is used alone, unqualifyingly, it is 
employed in the sense of <i>micchā ditthi</i> - wrong belief. </p>

<p><i>Sammā ditthi</i> or <i>amoha</i> is used as the antithesis of <i>moha.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>Māna</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>man,</i>
to think. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. <b>Dosa</b> - See Ch. 1, note 9. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Issā</b> - Derived from <i>i +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>su,</i> to be envious, to be jealous. </p>

<p>It has the characteristic of envying others&#39; success and prosperity. As such 
it is objective. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Macchariya</b> - </p>

<p><i>Maccharassa bhāvo</i> - the state of an avaricious person. </p>

<p>Commentary gives another explanation:- </p>

<p>&#39;Let not this wonder be to others, but to myself&#39;. </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Mā idam acchariyam aññesam hotu, mayham&#39;ev hotu). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>macchariya</i> is the concealment of one&#39;s 
prosperity. Contrary to <i>issā, </i>this is subjective. </p>

<p>Both <i>issā</i> and <i>macchariya</i> are regarded as the friends of <i>dosa</i>
because each of them arises with it. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Kukkucca</b> - </p>

<p><i>Kukatassa bhāvo = kukkuccam</i> = the state of having done amiss. </p>

<p>According to the commentary evil that is done is <i>ku + kata,</i> and so is 
good that is not done. Remorse over the evil that is done is <i>kukkucca,</i> 
and so is remorse over the good that is not done. </p>

<p>It has the characteristic of grieving over the evil that is done and the good 
that is not done. </p>

<p>Dhammasangani explains:-</p>

<p>&quot;What is worry?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Consciousness of what is lawful in something that is unlawful, consciousness 
of what is unlawful in something that is lawful; consciousness of what is 
immoral in something that is moral; consciousness of what is moral in something 
that is immoral - all this sort of worry, fidgeting, over-scrupulousness, 
remorse of conscience, mental sacrificing - this is what is called worry&quot;.</p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology - p. 313). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Kukkucca</i> is one of the five Hindrances and is used together with
<i>uddhacca</i>. It pertains to past things only. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Vinaya, <i>kukkucca</i> is healthy doubt with regard to rules, 
and is commended. According to Abhidhamma, on the contrary, it is repentance 
which is not commended. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Thīna</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>the,</i>
to shrink, <i>+ na. Thena = thāna = thīna. </i></p>

<p>It is the shrinking state of the mind like a cock&#39;s feather before fire. It 
is opposed to <i>viriya. Thīna</i> is explained as <i>citta - gelaññam,</i>
sickness of the mind. </p>

<p>As such it is the antithesis of <i>citta-kammaññatā,</i>
adaptability of the mind, one of the <i>sobhana cetasikas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Middha</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>middh,</i>
to be inactive, to be inert, to be incapable. </p>

<p>This is the morbid state of the mental factors. </p>

<p>Both <i>thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> are always used in conjunction, and are 
one of the five Hindrances. They are inhibited by <i>vitakka,</i> initial 
application, one of the Jhāna factors. <i>Middha,</i> too, is opposed to <i>
viriya.</i>
Where there are <i>thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> there is no <i>viriya. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Middha</i> is explained as the <i>kāya-gelañña,</i> sickness of the mental 
body. Here body is not used in the sense of material form, but is applied to the 
body of mental factors, viz., <i>vedanā, saññā and sankhāra</i> (feeling, 
perception, and the remaining fifty mental factors). Hence <i>middha</i> is the 
antithesis of <i>kāya-kammaññatā,</i> adaptability of mental factors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both <i>thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> are explained in the Dhammasangani as 
follows:- </p>

<p>&quot;What is stolidity <i>(thīna)?&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;That which is indisposition, unwieldiness of intellect, adhering and 
cohering; clinging, cleaving to, stickiness; stolidity, that is, a stiffening, a 
rigidity of the intellect - this is called stolidity. </p>

<p>&quot;What is torpor <i>(middha)?&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;That which is indisposition, unwieldiness of sense, a shrouding, enveloping, 
barricading within; torpor that which is sleep, drowsiness; sleep, slumbering, 
somnolence this is called torpor&quot;. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Vicikicchā</b> - See Ch. 1, note 13. </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vicikicchā,</i> as a Hindrance, does not mean doubts with regard to the 
Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, etc., </p>

<p>Majjhima Nikāya commentary states - &quot;it is so called because it is incapable 
of deciding that it is as such.&quot; </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Idam&#39;ev&#39;idanti nicchetum asamatthabhāvato&#39;ti vicikicchā). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Saddhā</b> - <i>Sam,</i> well; + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dah,</i>
to establish, to place, to put. </p>

<p>Sanskrit <i>sraddhā</i> is composed of <i>Srat</i> = faith + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>dha</i> to establish. </p>

<p>According to Pāli, <i>saddhā</i> is well-established confidence in the 
Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha. Purification <i>(sampasādana)</i> of its mental 
associates is its chief characteristic. It is compared to the water-purifying 
gem of the universal monarch. This particular gem, when thrown into water, 
causes mud and water-weeds to subside. The water is consequently purified. In 
the same way <i>saddhā</i> purifies the mind of its stains. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This <i>saddhā</i> is not blind faith. It is confidence based on knowledge. </p>

<p>One might question whether a non-Buddhist could also possess this <i>saddhā.
</i></p>

<p>Atthasālini raises this very question and provides an answer which is rather 
unsatisfactory and inadequate. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Do men of false opinions not believe in their own teachers?&quot; questions 
Venerable Buddhaghosa. His answer is:-</p>

<p>&quot;They do. But that is not <i>saddhā,</i> it is a mere acquiescence in words <i>
(vacana-sampaticchana-mattameva)&quot;. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If <i>saddhā</i> is limited only to Buddhists, what shall we say when a 
non-Buddhist places his faith or confidence in his teacher? Surely his mind also 
gets purified to some extent when he thinks of his particular religious teacher.</p>

<p>Could it be <i>ditthi</i> - false view? Then it is immoral <i>(akusala).</i>
In such a case there is no occasion for a non-Buddhist to experience a moral 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Would it not be more correct to say that <i>saddhā</i> is mere confidence or 
faith, instead of restricting it to the Triple Gem? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dhammasangani explains <i>saddhā</i> as follows:-</p>

<p>&quot;The faith which on that occasion is trusting in, the professing confidence 
in, the sense of assurance, faith, faith as a faculty and as a power&quot;. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, p. 14.)</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Saddhā</i> is also apprehension intuitively of experience or knowledge 
gathered in past births. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Sati</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sar,</i>
to remember. </p>

<p><i>Sati</i> does not exactly correspond to the Western conception of memory. 
Mindfulness is a better equivalent for <i>sati.</i> It has to be developed. In 
the Satipatthāna Sutta are described in detail various methods to develop this <i>
sati.</i>
When it is highly developed one acquires the power of remembering past births. 
It is this <i>sati</i>
that is regarded as one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. </p>

<p><i>Sati</i> tends to present before oneself good things without allowing them 
to be forgotten. Its chief characteristic is &#39;not floating away&#39; <i>(apilāpana).</i>
Unlike pumpkins and pots that float on water, <i>sati</i> plunges into the 
object of thought. </p>

<p>It should be noted that this particular <i>sati</i> is not found in immoral 
types of consciousness. </p>

<p>What is found in immoral consciousness is <i>micchā sati</i> (wrong 
mindfulness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dhammasangani explains <i>sati</i> as follows:-</p>

<p>&quot;The mindfulness which on that occasion is recollecting, calling back to 
mind; the mindfulness which is remembering, bearing in mind, the opposite of 
superficiality and of obliviousness; mindfulness as faculty; mindfulness as 
power, right mindfulness&quot;. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, p. 16). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Commenting on <i>sati,</i> Mrs. Rhys Davids says:-</p>

<p>&quot;Buddhaghosa&#39;s comment on <i>sati,</i> in which he closely follows and 
enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38, shows that the traditional conception of 
that aspect of consciousness had much in common with the Western modern theory 
of conscience or moral sense. <i>Sati</i> appears under the metaphor of an 
inward mentor, discriminating between good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy 
went so far as to render it by &#39;conscience&#39;, but this slurs over the interesting 
divergence&#39;s between Eastern and Western thought. The former is quite unmystical 
of the subject of <i>sati.</i> It takes the psychological process or 
representative functioning (without bringing out the distinction between bare 
memory and judgment), and presents the same under an ethical aspect&quot;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Hiri &amp; Ottappa</b> - See <i>ahirika</i> and <i>anottappa</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Alobha</b> - </p>

<p>This is opposed to <i>lobha</i> (See Ch. 1 note 9). </p>

<p><i>Dāna</i> or generosity is implied thereby. This is a positive virtue 
involving active altruism. It is one of the three roots of good. Like a drop of 
water that runs off a lotus leaf without adhering to it, non-adhesion to an 
object is its chief characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Adosa</b> - </p>

<p>This is opposed to <i>dosa</i> (See Ch. 1 note 9). It is not mere absence of 
hatred or aversion, but is a positive virtue. </p>

<p><i>Adosa</i> is synonymous with <i>mettā,</i> Loving-kindness, which is one 
of the four sublime abodes <i>(brahma-vihāra)</i>. </p>

<p>Readers will note that in enumerating the sublime abodes only two are 
mentioned, viz. - <i>karunā</i> and <i>muditā.</i> The reason being that <i>
mettā</i>
is implied by this <i>adosa;</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> by <i>tatramajjhattatā,</i>
equanimity.</p>

<p><i>Adosa</i> is also one of the three roots of good. Like an agreeable 
friend, absence of churlishness or coarseness <i>(candikka)</i> is its chief 
characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Three Roots of Good:</b> -</p>

<p><i>Alobha, adosa and amoha</i> are the three roots of good. <i>Amoha</i>
is not mentioned amongst the nineteen Beautiful <i>cetasikas</i> because it is 
implied by <i>paññā</i>
- wisdom.</p>

<p>Atthasālini gives a vivid description of these three virtues as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Of these three, <i>alobha</i> has the characteristic of non-adhesion of the 
mind to an object, or of not sticking like a drop of water on a lotus leaf. Its 
function is non-appropriation like an emancipated Bhikkhu (Arahat). Its 
manifestation is detachment like a man fallen in filth. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Adosa</i> has the characteristic of non-churlishness or non-resentment 
like an agreeable friend. Its function is the suppression of annoyance or 
feverishness like sandal wood. Its manifestation is loveliness like the full 
moon. The characteristic, function, etc., of <i>amoha</i> have been explained in 
connection with the term <i>paññindriya</i> (Faculty of Wisdom). Of these three, 
again, <i>alobha</i> is opposed to the taint of selfishness, <i>adosa</i> to 
that of impurity <i>(dussīlya), amoha</i> to the non-development of moral 
conditions. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Alobha </i>is the cause of generosity, <i>adosa</i> of morality, <i>amoha</i> 
of meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> what is in excess is not taken, for the greedy take 
what is in excess. Through <i>adosa</i> what is not less is taken, for the 
hateful take what is less. Through <i>amoha</i> what is unperverted is taken, 
for the deluded take what is perverted. Through <i>alobha,</i> one regards a 
manifest fault as such and admits it, but the greedy conceal it. Through <i>
adosa</i> one regards a manifest virtue as such and admits it, but the hateful 
efface it. Through <i>amoha,</i> one regards what really is as such and admits 
it, but the deluded regard what is false as true, and what is true as false. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is no sorrow arising from separation of the 
beloved, for affection is the intrinsic nature of the greedy as well as the 
inability to bear the separation from the beloved. Through <i>adosa</i> there 
arises no sorrow from association with the unbeloved since disagreeableness is 
the intrinsic nature of the hateful as well as the inability to bear the 
association with the unbeloved. Through <i>amoha</i> there arises no sorrow from 
not getting what one desires, for it is the intrinsic nature of the deluded to 
think - &#39;From where could it be got?&#39; etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there arises no sorrow from rebirth, since the former 
is opposed to craving and the latter is the root of craving. Through <i>adosa</i>
there arises no sorrow from decay, since the intensely hateful become quickly 
aged. Through <i>amoha</i> there is not sorrow from death, for a bewildered 
death is painful. There is no such death for the undeluded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;There is harmonious living to the lay people through <i>alobha,</i>
to the recluses through <i>amoha,</i> and to all through <i>adosa.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;In particular through <i>alobha</i> there is no rebirth in the plane of 
Petas, since beings are generally born amongst Petas through craving. <i>Alobha</i>
is the antithesis of craving. Through <i>adosa</i> there is no rebirth in the <i>
niraya</i>
(Woeful State). Through hate, which is of a churlish nature, beings are born in 
woeful states resembling hatred. <i>Adosa</i> is the antithesis of hatred. 
Through <i>amoha</i>
there is no rebirth in the animal plane. Due to utter delusion through 
ignorance, beings are born amongst animals. <i>Amoha</i> is the antithesis of 
ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Of them <i>alobha</i> dissuades attraction from lust; <i>adosa</i>
from recoiling through hate; <i>amoha</i> from stolid indifference through 
ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover through these three there arise respectively these three notions - 
those of renunciation, non-anger and harmlessness; and those of loathsomeness, 
immeasurableness, and fundamental elements<i> (dhātu). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> the extreme of indulgence in sensual pleasures is 
inhibited: through <i>adosa</i> that of self-mortification. Through <i>amoha</i>
there is training according to the Middle Path. </p>

<p>&quot;Similarly through <i>alobha</i> the bodily bond of covetousness <i>(abhijjhā 
kāyagantha)</i> is destroyed, through <i>adosa</i> that of ill-will, and through <i>
amoha</i>
the remaining two. </p>

<p>&quot;The first two states of mindfulness are accomplished by the power of the 
first two, and the last two by the power of the third. </p>

<p>&quot;Herein <i>alobha</i> is conducive to health, for the unattached person does 
not resort to what is attractive but suitable - hence health ensues. <i>Adosa</i>
is conducive to youthfulness, for the unhateful person remains young for a long 
time, being not burnt by the fire of anger which causes wrinkles and grey hair. <i>
Amoha</i> is conducive to longevity of life, for the undeluded person, 
distinguishing between what is agreeable and disagreeable, avoids the latter and 
adopts the former and lives long. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to the acquisition of wealth, for by generosity 
wealth is obtained. <i>Adosa</i> is conducive to the acquisition of friends, for 
by loving-kindness friends are won and are not lost. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Amoha</i> is conducive to personal achievements, for the undeluded 
person, doing only what is beneficial to himself, regulates his own self. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to divine life, <i>adosa</i> to Brahma life, and <i>
amoha</i> to Aryan life. </p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> one is at peace with his acquisition of wealth amongst 
beings and things belonging to one&#39;s party, for through their destruction there 
is no grief caused to him by excessive attachment. Through <i>adosa</i> amongst 
those belonging to other parties he is happy, for the non inimical person is 
devoid of the feeling of ill-will even amongst the hostile. Through <i>amoha</i> 
he is happy amongst those who belong to a neutral party, for the undeluded 
person is devoid of all attachment.
</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is insight into impermanence, for the greedy 
person does not see impermanence in things that are impermanent, owing to his 
desire for enjoyment. Through <i>adosa</i> there is insight into suffering for 
one with a loving-disposition has abandoned that grasping, the cause of 
vexation, and sees things as sorrowful. Through <i>amoha</i> there is insight 
into soullessness, for the undeluded person is skillful in understanding things 
as they truly are. He sees the guideless fivefold group as guideless. </p>

<p>&quot;As insight into impermanence and so on is brought about by these three 
states, so are these states brought about by insight into impermanence and so 
on. </p>

<p>&quot;Through insight into impermanence there is <i>alobha;</i> through insight 
into sorrow, <i>adosa;</i> through insight into soullessness, <i>amoha.</i> </p>

<p>&quot;Who indeed knowing well that this is impermanent would develop a desire for 
it? Who indeed perceiving ill in things would develop another ill caused by 
exceedingly violent anger? Who indeed realizing the emptiness of a soul would 
again fall into utter delusion? </p>

<p>35. <b>Tatramajjhattatā - </b></p>

<p>Lit., <i>tatra</i> = there, i.e., with respect to objects <i>majhattatā</i>
= middleness, that is, equipoise. </p>

<p>Impartial view of objects is its chief characteristic. It is compared to a 
charioteer who views equally a pair of well-trained horses. </p>

<p><i>Tatramajjhattatā</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> (equanimity) are sometimes used as 
synonymous terms. It is this <i>tatramajjhattatā</i> that is regarded as <i>
upekkhā</i>
of the four Sublime abodes. Hence <i>upekkhā</i> does not occur amongst the 
Sublime abodes. It is this <i>tatramajjhattatā</i> that is raised to the dignity 
of a <i>Bojjhanga,</i>
one of the seven factors of Enlightenment. <i>Tatra-majjhattatā</i> has also to 
be distinguished from hedonic <i>upekkhā</i> or indifference. At times both 
these mental states simultaneously arise in the same consciousness, e.g., in all <i>
upekkhā-sahagata kusala cittas.</i> </p>

<p>This <i>tatramajjhattatā</i> is regarded both as an intellectual and ethical <i>
upekkhā</i> (See Ch. 1. note, 42). </p>

sambh, </i>to calm, to be tranquil. </p>

<p><i>Passambh + ti = passadhti = passaddhi. </i></p>

<p><i>Passaddhi</i> is tranquillity, calmness, quietude, serenity. </p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>passaddhi</i> is the suppression or the 
allaying of feverishness of passions <i>(kilesadarathavūpasama). </i>It is like 
the cool shade of a tree to a person affected by the sun&#39;s heat. <i>Passaddhi</i> 
is opposed to <i>uddhacca,</i>
restlessness, or excitement. When highly developed it becomes a factor of 
Enlightenment <i>(bojjhanga).</i></p>

<p>This tranquillity is twofold, viz., tranquillity of <i>kāya</i> and <i>citta.</i>
Here <i>kāya</i> is not used in the sense of material body. It is the body of 
psychic factors - namely, <i>vedanā</i> (feeling), <i>saññā</i> (perception), 
and <i>sankhāra</i>
(mental states). It should be understood that <i>kāya</i> is used in the same 
sense in the subsequent <i>cetasikas</i>. <i>Citta</i> connotes the whole 
consciousness. The difference therefore lies between psychic factors and 
consciousness as a whole. The same explanation applies to the other pairs as 
well. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Kāya-Lahutā &amp; Citta-Lahutā - </b></p>

<p>Derived from <i>laghu,</i> light, quick. (Skt. <i>laghutā).</i> <i>Lahutā</i>
is bouyancy or lightness. Suppression of the heaviness of the mind and mental 
factors is its chief characteristic. It is like the laying down of a heavy 
burden. It is opposed to <i>thīna</i>
and <i>middha</i> - sloth and torpor - which cause heaviness and rigidity in 
mental factors and consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Kāya-Mudutā &amp; Citta-Mudutā - </b></p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>mudutā</i> is the suppression of stiffness and 
resistance. It removes stiffness and becomes pliable in receiving objects. It is 
compared to a skin that is well moulded by applying oil, water etc. It is 
opposed to false views and conceit <i>(ditthi and māna)</i> which cause 
stiffness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Kāya-Kammaññatā &amp; Citta-Kammaññatā - </b></p>

<p><i>Kamma + nya + tā = Kammanyatā = Kammaññyatā.</i> Lit., workableness or 
serviceableness. </p>

<p>Its chief characteristic is the suppression of unserviceableness or 
unworkableness of consciousness and its factors. It is like a heated metal made 
fit for any use. It is opposed to all the remaining Hindrances. Atthasālini 
states that these two allied concomitants produce serenity <i>(pasāda) </i>in 
propitious things, and are adaptable like pure gold, for beneficial works. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40.<b> Kāya-Pāguññatā &amp; Citta-Pāguññatā - </b></p>

<p>This is proficiency or skillfulness. Its chief characteristic is the 
suppression of sickness of mind and its concomitants. It is opposed to such 
passions as faithlessness etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Kāyujjukatā &amp; Cittujjukatā - </b></p>

<p>This is straightness or rectitude, and is opposed to crookedness, deception 
and craftiness. Its chief characteristic is straightness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. All these 19 concomitants are common to all types of moral consciousness, 
unlike the immoral concomitants which do not arise in an immoral consciousness <i>
in toto.</i> No moral consciousness arises without all of them. Along with this 
&#39;Beautiful&#39; group some other moral concomitants may arise according to the type 
of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43.<b> Virati - </b></p>

<p><i>Vi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> r<i>am,</i> to delight in. <i>Virati</i>
is refraining from, delighting in, i.e., abstinence. </p>

<p>According to the Atthasālini there are three kinds of <i>virati</i> - namely, <i>
sampatta-virati, samādāna-virati,</i> and <i>samuccheda-virati. </i></p>

<p><i>Sampatta-virati</i> is abstaining from evil as occasion arises considering 
one&#39;s birth, age, education, etc. </p>

<p><i>Samādāna-virati</i> is abstaining from evil in accordance with one&#39;s 
observances. For example, a Buddhist would abstain from killing, stealing, etc., 
as he observes the precepts not to kill, etc. </p>

<p><i>Samuccheda-virati</i> is the abstinence of an Aryan Disciple by completely 
eradicating all the roots of evil. </p>

<p>In the case of the former two, violation of good principles is possible; but 
in the case of Arahats it is not, because they have destroyed all passions. </p>

<p>Here are enumerated three Abstinences pertaining to wrong speech, wrong 
actions, and wrong livelihood. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, these three mental concomitants collectively arise only in 
the Supra mundane consciousness<i> (lokuttara citta).</i> In other cases they 
arise separately because there are three <i>cetanās.</i> </p>

<p>These three when present in the <i>lokuttara citta</i> are regarded as 
Factors of the Path <i>(magganga),</i> and they constitute <i>sīla</i> 
(Morality). <i>Sammā-ditthi</i>
and <i>sammā sankappa</i> which constitute <i>paññā</i> (Wisdom) are implied by <i>
paññindriya</i>
and <i>vitakka-cetasikas</i> respectively. <i>Sammā vāyāma, sammā sati,</i> and <i>
sammā samādhi</i> which constitute <i>samādhi,</i> (Concentration) are implied 
by <i>viriya, sati,</i> and <i>ekaggatā</i> <i>cetasikas</i> respectively. </p>

<p><i>Sammā vācā</i> deals with abstinence from false speech <i>(musāvāda),</i>
slandering <i>(pisuna-vācā),</i> harsh speech<i> (pharusa-vācā)</i> and 
frivolous talk
<i>(sampapphalāpa). </i></p>

<p><i>Sammā kammanta </i>deals with abstinence from killing <i>(pānātipāta),</i>
stealing <i>(adinnādāna), </i>and sexual misconduct <i>(kāmesu micchācāra). </i></p>

<p><i>Sammā ājīva</i> deals with abstinence from selling poison, intoxicants, 
weapons, slaves and animals for slaughter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. <b>Appamaññā - </b></p>

<p>As the object of these virtues is the infinite number of beings, they are 
called <i>appamaññā,</i> lit., illimitable (Skt. <i>aprāmānya).</i> They are 
also called <i>brahma vihāra</i> -Sublime Modes of Living. </p>

<p><i>Mettā, karunā, muditā, </i>and <i>upekkhā</i> are these four illimitables. </p>

<p>As explained above <i>mettā</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> are represented by
<i>adosa</i> and <i>tatra-majjhattatā.</i> Hence only two are mentioned here. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45.<b> Mettā - </b></p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>mid,</i> to soften, to love. 
According to Sanskrit <i>mitrasya bhāvah = maitri;</i> state of a friend. That 
which softens the mind, or friendly disposition is <i>mettā.</i></p>

<p>Goodwill, benevolence, loving-kindness are suggested as the best renderings. <i>
Mettā</i> is not carnal love or affection. The direct enemy of <i>mettā</i>
is hatred or ill-will <i>(kodha),</i> its indirect enemy is affection <i>(pema). 
Mettā</i>
embraces all beings without exception. The culmination of <i>mettā</i> is the 
identification of oneself with all beings <i>(sabbattatā). </i></p>

<p><i>Mettā</i> is the sincere wish for the good and welfare of all. It discards 
ill-will. </p>

<p>Benevolent attitude is its chief characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46.<b> Karunā - </b></p>

<p><font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>Kar,</i> to do, to make + <i>unā. </i></p>

<p>That which makes the hearts of the good quiver when others are afflicted with 
sorrow is <i>karunā.</i> That which dissipates the sufferings of others is
<i>karunā.</i></p>

<p>The wish for the removal of sufferings of others is its chief characteristic. 
Its direct enemy is wickedness <i>(himsā) </i>and its indirect enemy is grief <i>
(domanassa). Karunā</i> embraces sorrow-afflicted beings. It discards cruelty. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47.<b> Muditā - </b></p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>mud,</i> to be pleased. </p>

<p>It is not mere sympathy but appreciative joy. Its direct enemy is jealousy 
and its indirect enemy is exultation <i>(pahāsa).</i> Its chief characteristic 
is happy acquiescence in others&#39; prosperity <i>(anumodanā). Muditā</i> embraces 
prosperous beings. It discards dislike <i>(arati),</i> and it is the 
congratulatory attitude of a person. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>48. Upekkhā - </b></p>

<p><i>Upa</i> = impartially, justly + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ikkh,</i>
to see, to view, to look. </p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> is to view impartially, i.e., neither with attachment nor with 
aversion. It is the balanced state of mind. Its direct enemy is passion <i>
(rāga),</i>
and its indirect enemy is unintelligent indifference. Attachment and aversion 
are eliminated by <i>upekkhā.</i> Impartial attitude is its chief 
characteristic. </p>

<p>Here <i>upekkhā</i> does not mean mere neutral feeling, but a sterling virtue 
is implied thereby. Equanimity is the closest equivalent. That term, too, 
conveys only one aspect of <i>upekkhā.</i> (See Ch. 1, notes 10, 42). It is this <i>
upekkhā</i>
that is elevated to a <i>bojjhanga</i> factor. </p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> embraces all good and bad ones, loved and unloved ones, 
agreeable and disagreeable things, pleasure and pain and all such similar 
opposite pairs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>49. </b>The following illuminating note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on these four 
virtues is well worth reading. </p>

<p>&quot;On these four great exercises, see Rhys Davids, S. B. E. xi 201, n.; and on 
their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa again refers to the reader to 
his Visuddhi Magga for a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix, and cf. Hardy, 
&#39;Eastern Monachism&#39;, p . 243 et seq. )... The object of thought <i>(ārammana)</i> 
in this connection will be &#39;limited&#39; if the student dwells in love etc., on but 
a restricted number of beings; &#39;infinite&#39; if his heart embraces vast numbers.</p>

<p>&#39;The commentator has not a little to say in the present work, however, on the 
nature and mutual relations of the &#39;Abodes&#39; (pp. 193-195). First, the 
characteristics of each are fully set forth, together with their false 
manifestation <i>(vipatti).
</i>Clinging <i>(sinehasambhavo)</i> is the <i>vipatti</i> of love, the 
essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent conduct etc. Tears and 
the like are less truly characteristic of pity <i>(karunā)</i> than is the 
bearing and relieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are less genuine 
expressions of sympathy <i>(muditā) </i>than is appreciation of what others have 
achieved. And there is a condition of disinterestedness <i>(upekkhā)</i> which 
is prompted by ignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of mankind 
which can avail to calm the passions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;He next designates the four antisocial attitudes which are to be extirpated 
by these ethical disciplines taken in order - ill-will <i>(vyāpāda),</i>
cruelty <i>(vihesā),</i> aversion <i>(arati), </i>and passion <i>(rāga) </i>- 
and shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms 
its near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical opposite, 
the latter resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. 
Love and vengeful conduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let love 
be developed fearlessly. But where love and its object have too much in common, 
love is threatened by lust. On this side let love be guarded well. Again the 
near enemy to pity, more insidious than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for 
what one has not got or has lost - a low, profane melancholy. And the 
corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, or in consequence of 
obliviousness as to what one has lost, lies in wait to stifle appreciation of 
the good fortune of others. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of 
the worldling who has not triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and 
effect, being unable to transcend external things.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The remainder of his remarks are occupied with the necessary sequence in the 
four Abodes, and the importance of observing method in their cultivation, and 
finally with their other technical appellation of <i>appamaññā</i> or 
infinitudes. In this connection he repeats the touching illustration given in 
Hardy (op. Cit., 249) of the mother, and the four children. Her desire for the 
growth of the infant is as <i>mettā;</i>
for the recovery of the sick child as <i>karunā;</i> for the maintenance of the 
gifts displayed by the youth as <i>muditā;</i> while her care not to hinder the 
career of her grown-up son is as <i>upekkhā.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;It may be remarked, by the way, that when Hardy with a foreigner&#39;s want of <i>
muditā</i> calumniates the Buddhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about 
the virtues of solidarity without practicing them, he quite forgets that these 
exercises are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the 
intellectual need of others to which the recluse&#39;s life was largely devoted, and 
the importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of charity, 
does not even now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did not believe in 
giving the rein to good impulses unregulated by intellectual control&quot;. </p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, pp- 65-37).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>50. Paññindriya -</b></p>

<p><i>Pa</i> = rightly; <i>ñā,</i> to know, <i>paññā,</i> literally, means right 
knowing. </p>

<p>Its chief characteristic is understanding as it really is, or irresistible 
understanding, i.e., penetrative knowledge <i>(Yathāsabhāva-pativedho vā 
akkhalita-pativedho). </i></p>

<p>As <i>paññā</i> dominates in understanding the real nature and as it 
overcomes ignorance, it is called a controlling faculty <i>(indriya). </i></p>

<p>In Abhidhamma <i>ñāna, paññā,</i> and <i>amoha</i> are used as 
interchangeable terms. In types of consciousness connected with knowledge <i>
(ñāna-sampayutta)</i>
the reference is to this <i>paññā.</i> By <i>amoha,</i> one of the three moral 
roots, is also meant this <i>paññā</i>. As one of the four means of 
accomplishing one&#39;s ends <i>(iddhi-pāda)</i>
it assumes the name of <i>vīmamsā</i> (lit., examination). When purified by <i>
samādhi,</i>
<i>paññā</i> assumes the honorable role of <i>abhiññā</i> (higher knowledge). 
Highly developed <i>paññā</i> is elevated to the state of a <i>
bojjhanga-dhamma-vicaya</i>
(Investigation of the Truth) and <i>magganga-sammā ditthi,</i> Right View. The 
culmination of <i>paññā</i> is the Omniscience of a Buddha. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Paññā,</i> in the strictest sense of the term, is seeing things as they 
truly are, i.e., in the light of <i>anicca</i> (impermanence), <i>dukkha</i>
(sorrow), and <i>anattā</i> (soullessness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reason, intellect, insight, knowledge, wisdom, intelligence - all convey some 
aspects of <i>paññā,</i> but none of them exactly corresponds to the Pāli term. 
Both knowledge and wisdom are employed here according to the context. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rhys David&#39;s comment on this important term is interesting. She writes:- </p>

<p>&quot;To fit the term <i>paññā</i> with its approximate European equivalent is one 
of the cruxes of Buddhist philosophy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, 
insight, science, understanding and knowledge. All of these have been, and are, 
used in the literature of philosophy with varying shades of connotation, 
according as the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and 
precise or transcendental and - <i>passez-moi le mot</i> - having precise 
vagueness.</p>

<p>And each of them might, with one implication or another, represent <i>paññā</i>. 
The main difficulty in choice lay in determining whether, to the Buddhist, <i>
paññā </i>stood for mental function, or for the aggregate product of certain 
mental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to <i>paññā </i>in the 
Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation becomes possible. Here it 
must suffice to quote two. M i. 292, he who has <i>paññā (paññavā) </i>is 
declared in virtue thereof to understand <i>(pajānāti)</i>
the nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 
124 Gotama asks: what is this <i>paññā</i>? and himself sets out its content as 
consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the Jhānas, insight into 
the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one&#39;s self, the power of <i>
iddhi,</i> the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, into one&#39;s own past lives, 
the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa 
also (Visuddhi Magga Ch. XIV,) distinguishes <i>paññā</i>
from <i>saññā</i> and <i>viññāna.</i> He describes it as adequate to discern not 
only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain 
and non-substantiality) respectively, but also the path. For him, then, it might 
be called intellect &#39;at a higher power&#39;. And in Gotama&#39;s reply, all those terms 
are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
the term did not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree of 
complexity, but that it also implied mental process as cultivated in accordance 
with a certain system of concepts objectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. 
Hence I think it best to reject such terms as reason, intellect, and 
understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, or knowledge, or philosophy. 
Only they must be understood in this connection as implying the body of learning 
as assimilated and applied by the intellect of a given individual&quot;. </p>

<p>Immoral Mental States</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>§ 6. (a) Of the Immoral mental states these four (*1) - namely, </p>
  <ul>
    <li>

<p>Delusion, (Moral) </p>

    </li>
    <li>

<p>Shamelessness, (Moral) </p>

    </li>
    <li>

<p>Fearlessness, and </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Restlessness - are common to every Immoral consciousness.</p>
      </li>
</ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
    <p>(b) Attachment is found only in the eight types of consciousness rooted 
	in attachment. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p>(c) Misbelief (*2) is found in the four types of consciousness 
	  accompanied by wrong view. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p>(d) Conceit (*3) is found in the four types of consciousness 
	  dissociated with wrong view. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p>(e) Hatred, Jealousy, Avarice, and Worry (*4) are found in the two 
	  types of consciousness accompanied by ill-will.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p>(f) Sloth and Torpor (*5) are found in the five types of prompted 
	consciousness. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p>(g) Doubt is found only in the type of consciousness accompanied by 
	doubt. </p>
        </li>
</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*1) The root of every evil is moha (ignorance), because the evil-doer is not 
aware of the evil consequences. With it are associated shamelessness to commit 
the evil and disregard for the effects that follow. There is a certain amount of 
restlessness of the mind when an evil is committed.]</p>

<p>(*2) As ditthi gives rise to the conception of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine connected with 
oneself, it occurs in the consciousness rooted in attachment]</p>

<p>(*3) Māna too originates with the &quot;I&quot; - conception connected with oneself. As 
such it also is present only in types of consciousness rooted in attachment. 
Nevertheless, both ditthi and māna do not arise simultaneously in one particular 
consciousness. Where there is ditthi there is no māna. Commentaries compare them 
to two fearless lions that cannot live in one den. Māna may arise in those four 
types of consciousness dissociated with ditthi. But it does not follow that māna 
is ever present in them.]</p>

<p>(*4) These four cannot arise in a consciousness rooted in attachment because 
there is some form of aversion in them instead of any of clinging. Even 
macchariya is a kind of aversion to others&#39; viewing with oneself.]</p>

<p>(*5) Thīna and Middha are by nature opposed to adaptability. They lack the 
urge. As such they cannot arise in types of consciousness that are unprompted 
(asankharika) which are naturally keen and active. They appear only in types of 
prompted consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

    <p>§ 7. Four are found in all Immorals, three in those rooted in attachment, 
	four in those rooted in ill-will and so are two in the prompted. </p>
    <p>Doubt is found in the consciousness accompanied by doubt. Thus the 
	fourteen are conjoined only with the twelve Immorals in five ways. </p>

      <p>§ 8. (a) Of the Beautiful, at first, the nineteen mental states common

      <p>(c) The Illimitables arise at times differently in twenty-eight types 
	  of consciousness - namely, the twelve Sublime types of consciousness, 
	  excluding the fifth Jhāna, the eight Moral types and the eight <i>sahetuka</i> 
	  functional types of Sense-sphere consciousness. Some, however say that 
	  Compassion and Appreciative Joy are not present in the types of 
	  consciousness accompanied by <i>upekkhā</i> (Equanimity or Indifference).

    <p>Wisdom is declared to be in forty-seven types. Beautiful are only in the

<p>Contents of Different Types of Consciousness</b></font></p>

<p>§ 10. Jealousy, Avarice, Worry, Abstinences (three), Compassion, Appreciative 
Joy, and Conceit arise separately and occasionally. So are Sloth and Torpor in 
combination. </p>

<p>The remaining factors, apart from those mentioned above (52&nbsp;-&nbsp;11&nbsp;=&nbsp;41), are 
fixed adjuncts. Now I shall speak of their combination accordingly. </p>

<p>Thirty six factors arise in the Supra mundane, thirty-five in the Sublime, 
thirty-eight in the Kāmāvacara Beautiful. </p>

<p>Twenty-seven in the Demeritorious, twelve in the Rootless. According to the 
way they arise their combination therein is fivefold. </p>

<a name='9-13' href='?#9-13'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr><font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>Supra mundane Consciousness</b></font></p>

<p>§ 11. How? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) At first in the eight types of Supra mundane first Jhāna types of 
  consciousness thirty-six factors enter into combination - namely, thirteen <i>
  aññasamānas,</i>
  and twenty-three Beautiful mental factors, excluding the two Illimitables* 
  (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;23&nbsp;=&nbsp;36) </p>
  <p>(b) Similarly in the Supramundane Second Jhāna consciousness, all the 
  above, excluding Initial Application.** </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(c) In the Third, (all those) excluding Initial Application and Sustained 
Application. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) In the Fourth, (all those) excluding Initial Application, Sustained 
  Application, and Joy. </p>
  <p>(e) In the Fifth Jhāna type of consciousness which is accompanied by 
  Equanimity, all those excluding Initial Application, Sustained Application, 
  Joy, and Happiness. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus in every way fivefold is the synthesis of mental factors arising in the 
eight types of Supra mundane consciousness according to the five Jhānas. </p>

<p>Respectively there are thirty-six, thirty-five, thirty-four, and thirty-three 
in the last two. </p>

<p>Thus in five ways they arise in the Supra mundane. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

</font>

<p>* Because their objects are living beings, while the lokuttara consciousness 
has Nibbāna for its object.</p>

<p>** Vitakka is eliminated in the 2nd Jhāna. The elimination of other factors 
in the remaining Jhānas should be similarly understood.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52. Aniyatayogi and Niyatayogi -</b></p>

<p>Of the 52 types of mental states eleven are called <i>aniyatayogi</i> - 
unfixed adjuncts. They arise in different kinds of consciousness separately 
because their particular objects differ. They may or may not arise in those 
types of consciousness to which they are allied. For instance, <i>issā, 
macchariya,</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> must arise in a consciousness connected with 
aversion. One of the three must arise at one particular moment. All the three do 
not occur simultaneously. Besides they are not bound to be present in such a 
consciousness. So are the three Abstinences, two Illimitables, Conceit, Sloth 
and Torpor. </p>

<p>The remaining 41 types are called <i>niyatayogi</i> - fixed adjuncts. They 
invariably arise in those types of consciousness allied to them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. Abstinences -</b></p>

<p>These three are collectively found only in the Supra mundane consciousness, 
as they constitute three of eight factors of the Noble Path. They cannot arise 
in the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara,</i> nor in the <i>kāmāvacara vipāka</i> 
and <i>kriyā cittas.</i> They deal with three forms of refraining from 
committing evil through word, deed, and livelihood. As such they arise 
separately only in the eight types of moral consciousness according to the 
abstinence from the particular evil. </p>

<p>These Abstinences appear in full force only in the <i>lokuttara-cittas,</i>
because the corresponding evils are completely eradicated by them. In the <i>
kāmāvacara-kusala-cittas</i>
there is only a temporary inhibition of evil.</p>

<p>As <i>kāmāvacara-vipāka-cittas</i> are merely effects they cannot arise in 
them. Since <i>kriyā-cittas</i> are experienced only by Arahats, they do not 
arise in them. In the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara</i> planes they do 
not occur because the need for moral purification, the function of these 
abstinences, does not arise there. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>54. Illimitables (Sublime Abodes)-</b></p>

<p>Of the four only two are mentioned here. The other two have already been 
dealt with in their respective places.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the objects of these tables are beings. Therefore 
they cannot arise in the Supra mundane consciousness which has for its object 
Nibbāna. This does not mean that Arahats and other Aryans do not possess these 
virtues. They are not present only in the Path and Fruit consciousness. </p>

<p>They do not occur in the fifth Jhāna as it is accompanied by <i>upekkhā</i>
- neutral feeling. In the <i>arūpa-cittas</i> also they do not arise as they 
also are connected with <i>upekkhā.</i> In the eight <i>kiriya cittas,</i> which 
the Arahats experience, they arise because the Arahats also radiate thoughts of <i>
karunā</i> and <i>muditā</i>
towards all beings. </p>

      <p>§ 14. (i) At first, in the first two (types of) Sense-Sphere Beautiful 
	  consciousness (*1) thirty-eight states go into combination - namely, 
	  thirteen miscellaneous and twenty-five Beautiful mental states. 
	  (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;25&nbsp;=&nbsp;38) </p>

<blockquote>
      <p>The two Illimitables and the three Abstinences should be fitted in

      <p>(ii) Similarly in the second couplet all of them arise excluding

      <p>(iii) in the third couplet, associated with Wisdom, Joy is excluded; </p>
      <p>(iv) in the fourth couplet Wisdom and Joy (*3) are excluded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Functional consciousness the three Abstinences are excluded. (*4) 
Likewise in the four couplets they are combined in four ways. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly in the Resultant consciousness they all arise except the 
Illimitables and the Abstinences. (*5) </p>

    <p>§ 15. With respect to Sense-Sphere consciousness with roots -Moral, 
	Resultant, and Functional - there arise in the Moral (first pair) 
	thirty-eight, twice (*6) thirty-seven (in the second and third pairs), and 
	thirty-six( in the fourth pair). In the Functional thirty-five (in the first

with wisdom.</p>

<p>(*2) Because they are not fixed adjuncts. They arise at different moments of 
conscious experience.</p>

<p>(*3) Being accompanied by upekkhā.</p>

<p>(*4) Because the Arahats have completely eradicated the Abstinences.</p>

<p>(*5) Illimitables do not arise because they have limitless beings as the 
objects, while the Resultants are restricted to lesser objects. The Abstinences 
are absolutely moral. Hence they do not arise in a resultant consciousness. In 
the Supramundane Fruit consciousness they however arise because it is like a 
reflection of the Path consciousness.</p>

<p>(*6) i.e., thirty-seven in each of the second and third couplets.</p>

<p>(*7) i.e. in the rūpāvacara arūpāvacara planes. Because no occasion arises 
for such evil to spring up.</p>

<p>(*8) The supramundane consciousness, when classified according to five 
Jhānas, differs with respect to Jhāna factors.</p>

<p>(*9) Ca in the text includes Jhāna factors.</p>

<p>(*10) Morals differ from Resultants and Functionals on account of 
Abstinences. Morals and Functionals differ from Resultants on account of 
Illimitables. Respective couplets differ on account of Wisdom and Joy.</p>

<p>Immoral Consciousness</font></p>

<p></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 17.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) Now, in immoral consciousness, to begin with, in the first unprompted 
  consciousness (*1) nineteen mental states enter into combination - namely, 
  thirteen unmoral concomitants, the four common immoral concomitants, making 
  seventeen, together with attachment and misbelief. (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;19) </p>
  <p>(ii) Similarly in the second unprompted consciousness (*2) the same 
  seventeen, together with attachment and conceit. (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;19) </p>
  <p>(iii) Similarly in the third unprompted consciousness there are eighteen 
  concomitants, together with attachment and misbelief but excluding joy.(*3) 
  (12&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) </p>
  <p>(iv) Similarly in the fourth (there are eighteen) with attachment and 
  conceit. (12&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) </p>
  <p>(v) In the fifth unprompted consciousness connected with aversion the above 
  twenty concomitants, excluding joy, (*4) are combined together with hatred, 
  jealousy, avarice and worry. Of them jealousy, avarice and worry should be 
  combined separately.(*5) (12&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;20) </p>
  <p>(vi) In the five types (*6) of prompted consciousness the above 
  concomitants should similarly be combined with this difference that sloth and 
  torpor are included. (21; 21; 20; 20; 22). </p>
  <p>(vii) In the type of consciousness connected with restlessness fifteen 
  mental states occur - namely, eleven <i>aññasamānas</i> excluding conation 
  (*7) and joy, and the four immoral Universals. (11&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;15) </p>
  <p>(viii) In the type of consciousness connected with perplexity fifteen 
  states are similarly obtained together with perplexity, but devoid of 
  decision.(*8) (10&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;15) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus in all the twelve types of immoral consciousness synthesis becomes 
sevenfold when reckoned according to their different combinations.(*9) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 18. Nineteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty, twenty-two, fifteen, - 
thus they stand in seven ways in the immoral consciousness. </p>

<p>Those fourteen mental states - namely, the four immoral universals, and ten 
unmorals,(*10) are said to be associated with all the immoral types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*1) i.e., Somanassa sakagata ditthigata sampayutta asankhārika citta - 
Unprompted consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, connected with misbelief.</p>

<p>(*2) i.e., the unprompted consciousness not connected with misbelief. Conceit 
and misbelief do not coexist.</p>

<p>(*3) i.e.. the unprompted consciousness accompanied by upekkhā. Joy does not 
coexist with indifference.</p>

<p>(*4) Joy does not coexist with aversion and grief.</p>

<p>(*5) Being unfixed mental adjuncts (aniyatayogino). Their objects differ and 
they arise severally.</p>

<p>(*6) They are the four types of prompted consciousness rooted in attachment 
and the one rooted in aversion. Sloth and torpor are present only in the immoral 
prompted consciousness.</p>

<p>(*7) There is no chanda, the will-to-do, as restlessness is predominant here.</p>

<p>(*8) Adhimokkha, the mental factor that dominates in deciding cannot exist in 
a perplexed mind.</p>

<p>(*9) (i) 1st and 2nd asankhārika citta = 19; (ii) 3rd and 4th asankhārika 
citta = 18; (iii) 5th asankhārika citta = 20; (iv) 1st and 2nd sasanhhārika 
citta = 21; (v) 3rd and 4th sasankhārika citta = 20; (vi) 5th sasankhārika citta 
= 22; (vii) moha citta&nbsp;=&nbsp;15. Thus they divide themselves into seven classes 
according to numbering.</p>

<p>(*10) i.e., excluding chanda, pīti, and adhimokha from the 13 aññasamānas.</p>

<p>Rootless Consciousness</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 19. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) With respect to Rootless, in the consciousness of aesthetic pleasure 
  (*1), to begin with, twelve unmoral mental states, excluding conation, enter 
  into combination. (7&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;l2) </p>
  <p>(ii) Likewise they occur in the Determining (*2) consciousness, excluding 
  conation and joy. (7 +&nbsp;4 = 11 ) </p>
  <p>(iii) In the Investigating consciousness, (*3) accompanied by pleasure, all 
  but conation and effort. (7 + 4 = 11) </p>
  <p>(iv) In the Mano-dhātu triple (*4) and in the pair of rootless relinking 
  (*5) types of consciousness, all except conation, joy, and effort. (7 + 3 - 
  10) </p>
  <p>(v) (v ) In the two types of fivefold sense-consciousness (*6) all enter 
  into combination except the Particulars. (7 ) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus in all the eighteen types of rootless consciousness the mental states, 
numerically considered, constitute four groups. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 20. Twelve , eleven , ten, seven - thus their grouping with respect to the 
eighteen rootless types of consciousness is fourfold. </p>

<p>In all the rootless the seven (Universals) occur. The rest (Particulars) 
arise accordingly. Thus in detail the groupings are told in thirty-three 
ways.(*7) </p>

<p>Understanding thus the combinations and synthesis of the mental adjuncts, let 
one explain their union with the consciousness accordingly.(*8) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*1) In the consciousness connected with laughter there is no wish-to-do, See 
Ch. 1, p.31.</p>

<p>(*2) It is the manodvāravajjana-mind-door consciousness-that assumes the name 
votthapana - Determining.</p>

<p>(*3) Although santīrana means investigating, it is a passive resultant 
consciousness. It lacks both will and effort.</p>

<p>(*4) Manodhātu - lit., the mere faculty of apprehension (mananamatta&#39; meva 
dhātu). It comprises the pancadvārāvajjana - sense-door consciousness, and the 
two sampaticchanas - recipient consciousness. The ten types of 
sense-consciousness are called dvipañca viññānadhātu. The remaining seventy-six 
types of consciousness are termed manoviññānadhātu, as they excel others in 
apprehension. </p>

<p>Both sampaticchanas are accompanied by upekkhā which does not coexist with 
pīti. Like the santīrana these two are resultants and are passive. Therefore 
they lack both effort and will. In the pancadvārāvajjana, too, as in 
manodvārāvajjana effort and will are lacking.</p>

<p>(*5) The two santīranas accompanied by upekkhā - both moral and immoral 
resultants are known as the ahetuka patisandhi yugala the pair of rootless 
relinking types of consciousness. Conception in woeful states is obtained by the 
akusala ahetuka santīrana, and amongst human beings as congenitally blind, deaf, 
etc., by the kusata ahetuka santīrana. This pair is also accompanied by upekkhā.</p>

<p>(*6) They are mere passive types of resultant consciousness.</p>

<p>(*7) Namely, i. 5 in anuttara; ii. 5 in mahaggata; iii. 12 in kāmāvacara; iv. 
7 in akusala; v. 4 in ahetuka; = 33.</p>

<p>(*8) In this chapter are explained in what types of consciousness the 
respective mental states are present and what types of mental states occur in 
each type of consciousness. </p>

<p>The author concludes the chapter advising the readers to explain the union of 
these mental states with each consciousness accordingly as, for example, - 
Universals are eighty-nine-fold because they are present in all the types of 
consciousness, phassa of the Particulars is fifty-fivefold because it arises in 
fifty-five types of consciousness, etc.</p>

<p>(i. Summary of Feeling) </b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>§ 2. In the summary of feeling (3) there are at first three kinds: - 
	pleasurable (4), painful, and that which is neither pleasurable nor painful. 
	Or, again, it is fivefold - namely, happiness, pain, pleasure, displeasure, 
	and indifference or equanimity. </p>
    <p>§ 3. Of them, moral resultant body-consciousness is the only one 
	accompanied by happiness. </p>
    <p>§ 4. Similarly immoral resultant body-consciousness is the only one 
	accompanied by pain. </p>
    <p>§ 5. There are sixty two kinds of consciousness accompanied by pleasure 
	(5) - namely: </p>
    <p>(a) the eighteen types of Sense-sphere consciousness, such as four rooted 
	in attachment, twelve types of sense-sphere Beautiful consciousness, the two 
	types of investigating and smiling consciousness, </p>
    <p>(b) forty-four types (6) of Sublime and Supramundane consciousness 
	pertaining to the first, second, third, and fourth Jhānas. (12 + 32) </p>
    <p>§ 6. Only the two types of consciousness connected with aversion are 
	accompanied by displeasure (7). </p>
    <p>§ 7. All the remaining fifty-five types of consciousness are accompanied 
	by indifference or equanimity (8). </p>
    <p>§ 8. Feeling, therein, is threefold - namely, happiness, pain, and 
	indifference. Together with pleasure and displeasure it is fivefold. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Happiness and pain are found in one, displeasure in two, pleasure in 
sixty-two, and the remaining (indifference or equanimity) in fifty-five. </p>

<a name='2-3' href='?#2-3'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes - </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Vedanā</b> is a significant mental state which is common to all types 
of consciousness. Feeling is its characteristic <i>(vedayita-lakkhana), </i>and 
is born of contact. Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering for <i>
vedanā. </i></p>

<p>Feeling is defined as: &quot;a conscious, subjective impression which does not 
involve cognition or representation of an object.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Sensation is explained as: &quot;the content of sensuous intuition, or the way in 
which a conscious subject is modified by the presence of an object.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Vedanā</i> modifies the stream of consciousness and serves both as a 
life-promoting and life-destroying force. Pleasure, for example, promotes life; 
pain impairs it. As such feeling plays a very important part in the life of man. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experiencing the taste of an object is the function of <i>vedanā (anubhavana 
rasa).</i> Particular likes and dislikes depend on the desirability and the 
undesirability of the external object. Generally they are mechanistic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes the freewill of a person determines the mode of feeling independent 
of the nature of the object. The sight of an enemy, for example, would normally 
be a source of displeasure, but a right-understanding person would, on the 
contrary, extend his loving-kindness towards him and experience some kind of 
pleasure. Socrates, for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and faced a 
happy death. Once a certain Brahman poured a torrent of abuse on the Buddha, but 
He kept smiling and returned love unto him. The ascetic Khantivādi, who was 
brutally tortured by a drunkard king, wished him long life instead of cursing 
him. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the other hand, may even, at the sight of a 
Buddha, harbour a thought of hatred. His feeling will be one of displeasure. 
Likewise a similar feeling may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhist at the 
sight of a religious teacher of an alien faith. What is meat and drink to one, 
may be poison to another. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Material pleasures, for instance, would be highly prized by an average 
person. An understanding recluse would find happiness in renouncing them and 
leading a life of voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a solitary life, a 
sensualist may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven to one may be hell to another; 
what is hell to one may be heaven to another. We ourselves create them, and they 
are more or less mind-made. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;There are, o Bhikkhus, two kinds of feeling-pain and happiness&quot;, says the 
Buddha. Well, then, how can there be a third which is neither pain nor 
happiness? The commentary states that blameless neutral feeling is included in 
happiness and the blameworthy in pain. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, the Buddha has stated that whatever is felt in this world, all that is 
pain. It is because of the changeable nature of all conditioned things. </p>

<p>From another standpoint considering all forms of feeling as purely mental, 
there are only three kinds - namely, happiness <i>(sukha),</i> pain <i>(dukkha), </i>
and neutral <i>(adukkhamasukha). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atthasālini explains them, as follows:-</p>

<p>The term <i>sukha</i> means &#39;pleasurable feeling&#39; <i>(sukha-vedanā), </i>
&#39;root of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-mūla),</i> &#39;pleasurable object&#39; <i>(sukhārammana),</i> 
&#39;cause of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-hetu),</i> &#39;conditioning state of pleasure, <i>
(sukha-paccayatthāna),</i>
free from troubles&#39; <i>(abyāpajjhā),</i> &#39;Nibbāna&#39;, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the expression: &quot;By eliminating <i>sukha</i>&quot; - <i>sukha</i>
means pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p>In the expression: &quot;<i>Sukha</i> is non-attachment in this world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means root of pleasure. </p>

<p>In the expression: &quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>sukha,</i> falls and descends 
on sukha&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means object of pleasure. </p>

<p>&quot;Merit, o Bhikkhus, is a synonym for <i>sukha</i>.&quot; Here <i>sukha</i>
means cause of pleasure. </p>

<p>&quot;Not easy is it, o Bhikkhus, to attain to heavenly <i>sukha</i> by 
description&quot;. &quot;They know not <i>sukha</i> who do not see <i>nandana</i>&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means conditioning state of pleasure. </p>

<p>&quot;These states constitute a <i>sukha</i> life in this very world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means freedom from troubles.</p>

<p>&quot;Nibbāna is supreme <i>sukha&#39;&#39;.</i> Here <i>sukha</i> means Nibbāna. </p>

<p>From these quotations the reader can understand in what different senses the 
term <i>sukha</i> is used in the texts. In this particular connection the term <i>
sukha</i>
is used in the sense of pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is stated to be supreme bliss <i>(sukha). </i>This does not mean that 
there is a pleasurable feeling in Nibbāna although the term <i>sukha</i> is 
used. Nibbāna is a bliss of relief. The release from suffering is itself 
Nibbānic bliss.
</p>

<p>The term <i>dukkha</i> means &#39;painful feeling&#39;, &#39;basis of pain&#39;, object of 
pain&#39;, cause of pain&#39;, &#39;conditioning state of pain&#39;, etc. </p>

<p>&#39;&#39;By eliminating <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means painful feeling. </p>

<p>&quot;Birth too is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means basis of pain. </p>

<p>&quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>dukkha</i>, falls and descends on pain&quot; - here <i>
dukkha</i> means object of <i>dukkha. </i></p>

<p>&quot;Accumulation of evil is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i>
means cause of pain. </p>

<p>&quot;It is not easy, o Bhikkhus, to realize the pain of woeful states by 
description&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means &quot;conditioning states of pain.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this particular connection the term <i>dukkha</i> is used in the sense of 
painful feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Dhammacakka Sutta the Buddha enumerates eight divisions of <i>dukkha
</i>-namely: </p>

<p>1. Birth is suffering, 2. decay is suffering, 3. disease is suffering, 4. 
death is suffering, 5. association with the unpleasant is suffering, 6. 
separation from the beloved is suffering, 7. when one does not obtain what one 
desires there is suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering. </p>

<p>All these are the causes of <i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Buddha addresses Devas and men He speaks of eight kinds of <i>
dukkha.</i>
When He addresses only men He speaks of twelve. Instead of <i>vyādhi</i> 
(disease) He says <i>soka</i> (grief), <i>parideva</i> (lamentation), <i>dukkha</i> 
(pain), <i>domanassa</i>
(displeasure) <i>upāyāsa</i> (despair) are suffering. All these five are 
included in <i>vyādhi</i>
which embraces both physical and mental disharmony. </p>

<p><i>Soka, domanassa,</i> and <i>upāyāsa</i> are mental, while <i>dukkha</i>
and <i>parideva</i> are physical. </p>

<p>Practically there is no marked difference between the two formulas. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Adukkha-m-asukha</b> is that which is neither pain nor happiness. It is a 
neutral feeling. This corresponds to both stolid indifference and Stoic 
indifference. The Pāli term <i>upekkhā,</i> which has a wider connotation, is 
more frequently used to denote this kind of neutral feeling. </p>

<p>In an immoral type of consciousness <i>upekkhā</i> assumes the role of stolid 
indifference because it is prompted by ignorance. In an <i>ahetuka</i> resultant 
consciousness, such as a sense-impression, <i>upekkhā</i> means simple neutral 
feeling which has no ethical value. <i>Adukkha-m-asukha</i> strictly applies in 
this connection. <i>Upekkhā</i>
latent in a <i>kāmāvacara sobhana citta</i> (Beautiful type of consciousness 
pertaining to the Sense-sphere) may be any of the following states - simple 
indifference (not stolid because there is no ignorance), simple neutral feeling, 
disinterestedness, unbiased feeling, Stoic indifference, and perfect equanimity. </p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> in the <i>jhāna</i> consciousness is perfect equanimity born 
of concentration. It is both ethical and intellectual. </p>

<p>See Ch. 1, Note 42. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a still wider classification <i>vedanā</i> is fivefold namely. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(i ) <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness),</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(ii) <i>somanassa</i> (mental pleasure),</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(iii) <i>dukkha</i> (physical pain), </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(iv) <i>domanassa</i> (mental displeasure), </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(v) <i>upekkhā</i> (indifference, equanimity, or neutral feeling ) . </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All feelings, from an ultimate standpoint, are mental because <i>vedanā</i>
is a <i>cetasikā.</i> But a differentiation has been made with regard to <i>
sukha</i> and
<i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p>Of all the 89 types of consciousness only two are associated with either <i>
sukha</i> or <i>dukkha.</i> One is the body-consciousness associated with 
happiness, and the other is body-consciousness associated with pain. </p>

<p>Both these are the resultant types of consciousness, effects of good and evil 
Kamma.</p>

<p>A soft touch, for instance, yields happiness. A pinprick, on the contrary, 
yields pain. In these cases one experiences the aforesaid two types of 
consciousness respectively. </p>

<p>Now a question arises - Why only the body-consciousness is associated with 
happiness and pain? Why not the other sense-impressions? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Aung provides an answer in his introductory essay to the Compendium: -</p>

<p>&quot;The sense of touch alone is accompanied by the positive hedonic elements of 
pain and pleasure; the other four senses are accompanied by hedonic 
indifference. This exceptional distinction is assigned to the sense of touch, 
because the impact between the sentient surface <i>(pasāda rūpa) </i>and the 
respective objects of other senses, both sets of which are secondary qualities 
of body, is not strong enough to produce physical pain or pleasure. But in the 
case of touch there is contact with one or other, or all the three primary 
qualities (locality - <i>pathavī,</i> temperature - <i>tejo,</i>
pressure - <i>vāyo)</i> and this is strong enough to affect those primary 
qualities in the percipient&#39;s own body. Just as cotton wool on the anvil does 
not affect the latter, but a hammer striking cotton wool imparts its check to 
the anvil also.&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Compendium of Philosophy p. 14). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of touch the impact is strong. The &quot;essentials&quot;, <i>pathavī, tejo</i> 
and <i>vāyo</i> (extension, heat, and motion) - <i>āpo,</i> cohesion, is 
excluded being intangible - forcibly and directly strike against the essentials 
of the body. Consequently there is either pain or happiness. In the case of 
seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting, there is a bare impact. The consequent 
feeling is neither pain nor happiness. </p>

<p>Although these sense-impressions may be <i>sukha, dukkha,</i> or <i>upekkhā</i>
the <i>javana</i> thought processes conditioned thereby may not necessarily be 
associated with a similar feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, the Buddha experienced a body-consciousness associated with 
pain when a rock splinter struck His foot, but His <i>javana</i> thought-process 
conditioned thereby would not necessarily be associate with displeasure. 
Unaffected by the pain, He would have experienced perfect equanimity. The 
immanent feeling in the stream of consciousness would have been <i>upekkhā.</i> 
Similarly at the sight of the Buddha, a right-understanding person would 
automatically experience an eye-consciousness associated with indifference <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata cakkhu-viññāna)</i> but his <i>javana</i>
thought would be moral. The innate feeling would be pleasure <i>(somanassa). </i></p>

<p>This intricate point should be clearly understood. </p>

<p><i>Somanassa</i> (good-mindedness ) and <i>domanassa</i>
(bad-mindedness) are purely mental. </p>

<p>These five kinds of feeling could be reduced to three, the three to two, and 
the two to one as follows:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <p>i. <i>sukha + somanassa; upekkhā; dukkha + domanassa </p>
        </li>
        </i>
    <li><p>ii. <i>sukha ; upekkhā; dukkha </p>
        </li>
        </i>
    <li><p>iii. <i>sukha; dukkha </p>
        </li>
        </i>
    <li><p>iv. <i>dukkha</i> </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><i>(Upekkhā</i> is merged in <i>sukha,</i> and <i>sukha</i> is ultimately 
merged in <i>dukkha).</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Sukha</b> - physical happiness should be differentiated from <i>
somanassa</i>
- mental pleasure. So should <i>dukkha</i> - physical pain - be differentiated 
from <i>domanassa</i>
- mental displeasure. There is only one consciousness accompanied by <i>sukha.</i>
Similarly there is only one accompanied by <i>dukkha.</i> Both of them are the 
effects of good and bad actions respectively. </p>

<p>When the Buddha, for instance, was injured by Devadatta Thera, He experienced 
a body-consciousness accompanied by pain. This was the result of a past evil 
action of His. When we sit on a comfortable seat we experience a body 
consciousness accompanied by happiness. This is the result of a past good 
action. All forms of physical pain and happiness are the inevitable results of 
our own Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Readers will note that pleasurable types of consciousness exceed all 
others. As such during a life-time a person experiences more happy moments than 
painful ones. This does not contradict the statement that life is sorrow <i>
(dukkha). </i>Here <i>dukkha</i>
is not used in the sense of painful feeling but in the sense of oppression or 
impeding <i>(pīlana).
</i>A careful reading of the description of <i>dukkha,</i> given in the 
Dhammacakka Sutta will make the matter clear. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. They are the four <i>kusala jhānas,</i> four <i>vipāka jhānas,</i>
four <i>kriya jhānas,</i> and thirty-two <i>lokuttara jhānas.</i> (4 + 4 + 4 + 
32 = 44) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. There is displeasure only in the two types of consciousness connected with <i>
patigha</i> or aversion. We experience displeasure when we get angry. </p>

<p>Is there aversion where there is displeasure? Yes, in a gross or subtle form.

<p>(ii. Summary of Roots)</b></font></p>

<p>§ 4. In the summary of roots (9) there are six-namely, attachment, hatred, 
delusion or ignorance, non-attachment or generosity, non-anger or good-will and 
wisdom. </p>

<p>Therein eighteen types of consciousness are without roots (10) - namely, 
five-door apprehending, the twice fivefold sense-impressions, receiving,

<p>All the remaining seventy-one (11) types of consciousness are with roots.</p>

<p>Of them the two types of consciousness (12) associated with ignorance have 
only one root. </p>

<p>The remaining ten immoral types (13) of consciousness and the twelve (14) 
Sense-sphere Beautiful types of consciousness, dissociated with wisdom - thus 
totaling twenty-two - are with two roots. </p>

<p>The twelve Sense-Sphere Beautiful types (15) of consciousness, associated 
with wisdom, and the thirty-five Sublime and Supramundane types of consciousness 
- totaling forty-seven - are with three roots. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 5. Attachment, hatred, and ignorance are the three immoral roots. Similarly 
non-attachment, good-will, and wisdom are moral and indeterminate (16). </p>

<h4>Notes-</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. See Ch. 1, N. 9. </p>

<p>For a detailed exposition of <i>hetu</i> see Dhammasangani <i>hetu-gocchakam,</i>
Sections 1053-1083; Buddhist Psychology, pp. 274-287.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Atthasālini there are four kinds of <i>hetu:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  </i><p>i. <i>hetu hetu,</i> the root cause or the root condition. </p>
  <p>There are three moral <i>hetus,</i> three immoral <i>hetus</i> and three 
  neutral <i>(avyākata) hetus.</i> Here <i>hetu</i> is used in the sense of 
  root. </p>
  <p>ii. <i>paccaya-hetu,</i> causal condition or instrumental cause. </p>
  <p>&quot;The four Great Essentials <i>(Mahābhūta),</i> o Bhikkhus, are the causes<i> 
  (hetu), </i>the conditions <i>(paccaya)</i> for the manifestation of 
  Form-Group <i>(rūpakkhandha).</i>&quot; </p>
  <p>Here <i>hetu</i> is used in the sense of causal relation <i>(paccaya-hetu).
  </p>
  <p></i>There is a subtle distinction between <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya.</i>
  The former signifies root <i>(mūla);</i> the latter, an aiding factor <i>
  (upakāraka dhamma).</i> <i>Hetu</i> is compared to the roots of a tree, and <i>
  paccaya</i> to manure, water and soil that aid its growth. </p>
  <p>This distinction should be clearly understood. </p>
  <p>It should also be noted that at times both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i>
  are used as synonymous terms. </p>
  <p>iii. <i>uttama-hetu,</i> chief cause or condition. A desirable object acts 
  as the chief <i>(uttama)</i> cause in producing a good result and an 
  undesirable one in producing a bad result. </p>
  <p>Here it means the chief cause. </p>
  <p>iv. <i>sādhārana-hetu,</i> the common cause or condition. </p>
  <p>Ignorance is the cause <i>(hetu),</i> condition <i>(paccaya)</i> of 
  volitional activities <i>(sankhārā). </p>
  <p></i>Here <i>hetu</i> is used as the general cause. Just as the essence of 
  both earth and water is the common cause of both sweetness and bitterness, 
  even so ignorance is the common cause of volitional activities. </p>
  <p>Though <i>hetu</i> assumes different shades of meaning in the Text, in this 
  particular instance it is used in the specific sense of root. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>10. All the <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are devoid of all roots. Hence they are 
neither moral nor immoral. They are regarded as unmoral. </p>

<p>Seven of them are the resultants of immoral actions, eight of moral actions, 
and three are merely functionals. See Ch. 1, pp. 27-31. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. i.e., 89-18 = 71. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. Namely, the consciousness accompanied by doubt <i>(vicikicchā) </i>and 
the other accompanied by restlessness <i>(uddhacca).</i> These are the only two 
types of consciousness that have one root, which is delusion. Being potentially 
weak, restlessness is powerless in determining a future birth. Both doubt and 
restlessness are regarded as two Fetters, the first of which is eradicated by 
the First Path, and the second by the Fourth Path of Sainthood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. The first eight immoral types of consciousness are connected with <i>
lobha</i>
(attachment) and <i>moha</i> (delusion) and the second two with <i>dosa</i> 
(aversion) and
<i>moha.</i> It should be noted that <i>moha</i> is common to all immoral 
thoughts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. Those twelve <i>kāmāvacara sobhana cittas</i> (mentioned in the first 
chapter) dissociated with <i>ñāna</i> or wisdom are conditioned by the two roots 
-
<i>alobha</i> (non-</p>

<p>attachment) and <i>adosa</i> (goodwill or loving-kindness). These two roots 
coexist in moral thoughts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. The remaining twelve <i>kāmāvacara sobhana cittas,</i>
accompanied by wisdom, are conditioned by all the three moral roots. </p>

<p>Similarly the 15 types of <i>rūpāvacara</i> consciousness, 12 types of <i>
arūpāvacara</i> consciousness, and the 8 types of <i>lokuttara</i> consciousness 
(15&nbsp;+&nbsp;12&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;= 35) are always associated with the three moral roots.</p>

<p>It should not be understood that evil thoughts conditioned by immoral roots 
do not arise in the <i>rūpaloka</i> and the <i>arūpaloka.</i> The point here 
stressed is that no immoral roots are found in the higher types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Unlike the other <i>kusala cittas,</i> the <i>lokuttara cittas,</i>
though associated with the three moral roots, lack procreative power. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Avyākata,</b> literally, means that which is not manifested. The term 
is applied to both <i>vipāka</i> (resultants) and <i>kriyā</i> (Functionals). <i>
Vipāka</i>
is a result in itself and is not productive of another result. <i>Kriya</i> does 
not produce any effect. <i>Rūpa</i> (material form) is also regarded as an <i>
avyākata</i>
because it does not reproduce any karmic result.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Ahetuka</i> - rootless types of consciousness = 18</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Ekahetuka</i> - types of consciousness with one root = 2</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Dvihetuka</i> - types of consciousness with two roots immoral = 10</p>

<p>moral = 12</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Tihetuka</i> - types of consciousness with three roots Beautiful = 12</p>

<p>Sublime = 27</p>

<p>Supramundane = 8</p>

<p>________</p>

<p>total = 89</p>

  (29), </p>
  <p>2. eight great resultants (30), and </p>
  <p>3. nine Form-Sphere and Formless Sphere resultants (31 ). (2 + 8 + 9 = 19). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two perform the function of apprehending (32).</p>

<p>Similarly two (33) perform the Functions of seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting, contacting, and receiving (34).</p>

<p>Three (35) perform the function of investigating. </p>

<p>The mind-door consciousness performs the function of determining (36) in the 
five sense-door (thought-process). </p>

<p>With the exception of two apprehending types of consciousness (37) the 
fifty-five (38) types of immoral, moral, and functional con<i>sc</i>iousness 
perform the function of <i>javana. </i></p>

<p>The eight great resultants and the three types of investigating 
consciousness, (totaling eleven) (39), perform the function of retention. </p>

<p>Of them the two types of investigating consciousness, accompanied by 
indifference, perform five functions such as relinking, life-continuum, decease, 
retention, and investigating. </p>

<p>The eight great resultants perform four functions such as relinking, 
life-continuum, decease, and retention. </p>

<p>The nine Sublime resultants perform three functions such as relinking, 
life-continuum, and decease (40). </p>

<p>The investigating consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, perform two 
functions such as investigating and retention. </p>

<p>Similarly the determining consciousness (41 ) perform two functions such as 
determining and apprehending. </p>

<p>All the remaining types of consciousness - <i>javana,</i> three mind-elements

<p>§ 7. The types of consciousness are declared to be fourteen according to 
functions such as relinking and so forth, and ten according to classification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>17. Kicca or Function. </b></p>

<p>In the first chapter consciousness was classified chiefly according to the 
nature <i>(jāti)</i> and planes or states <i>(bhūmi).</i> In this section the 
different functions of all the 89 types of consciousness are explained in 
detail.</p>

<p>Each consciousness performs a particular function. Some types of 
consciousness perform several functions, under different circumstances, in 
various capacities. There are fourteen specific functions performed by them all. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>18. Patisandhi, </b>literally, means re-linking. </p>

<p>The type of consciousness one experiences at the moment of conception is 
termed <i>patisandhi citta.</i> It is so called because it links the past with 
the present. </p>

<p>This <i>patisandhi citta,</i> also termed &#39;rebirth-consciousness,&#39; is 
conditioned by the powerful thought one experiences at the dying moment, and is 
regarded as the source of the present life-stream. In the course of one 
particular life there is only one <i>patisandhi citta.</i> The mental contents 
of <i>bhavanga,</i> which later arises an infinite number of times during one&#39;s 
lifetime, and of <i>cuti,</i> which arises only once at the final moment of 
death, are identical with those of <i>patisandhi. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>19. Bhavanga. </b><i>Bhava + anga</i> = factor of life, or indispensable 
cause or condition of existence. </p>

<p>One experiences only one thought-moment at any particular time. No two 
thought-moments coexist. </p>

<p>Each thought-moment hangs on to some kind of object. No consciousness arises 
without an object, either mental or physical. </p>

<p>When a person is fast asleep and is in a dreamless state he experiences a 
kind of consciousness which is more passive than active. It is similar to the 
consciousness one experiences at the initial moment of conception and at the 
final moment of death. This type of consciousness is in Abhidhamma termed <i>
bhavanga.</i> Like any other consciousness it also consists of three aspects - 
genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> static <i>(thiti)</i>
and cessation <i>(bhanga).</i> Arising and perishing every moment it flows on 
like a stream not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. </p>

<p>When an object enters this stream through the sense-doors, the <i>bhavanga</i>
consciousness is arrested and another type of consciousness appropriate to the 
object perceived arises. Not only in a dreamless state but also in our waking 
state we experience
<i>bhavanga</i> thought-moments more than any other types of consciousness. 
Hence <i>bhavanga</i>
becomes an indispensable condition of life. </p>

<p>Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. Aung compare <i>bhavanga</i> to &quot;Leibniz&#39;s state of 
obscure perception, not amounting to consciousness, in dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>One cannot agree because <i>bhavanga</i> is a type of consciousness. There is 
no obscure perception here. </p>

<p>Some identify <i>bhavanga</i> with sub-consciousness. According to the 
Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousness is &#39;&#39;a compartment of the mind 
alleged by certain psychologists and philosophers to exist below the threshold 
of consciousness.&quot; In the opinion of Western philosophers sub-consciousness and 
consciousness coexist. According to Abhidhamma no two types of consciousness 
coexist. Nor is <i>bhavanga</i> a sub-plane.</p>

<p>The Compendium further states that &quot;bhavanga denotes a functional state (or 
moment ) of sub-consciousness. As such it is the sub-conscious state of mind - 
&#39;below the threshold&#39; of consciousness - by which we conceive continuous 
subjective existence as possible. Thus it corresponds to F. W. Myer&#39;s 
&#39;subliminal consciousness&#39;&quot;.(<font SIZE="2"> p.266)</font></p>

<p>The Dictionary of Philosophy explains &#39;&#39;subliminal (sub, under + limen, the 
threshold) as allegedly unconscious mental processes especially sensations which 
lie below the threshold of consciousness.&quot; Strictly speaking, it does not 
correspond to subliminal consciousness either.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be any place for <i>bhavanga</i> in Western 
Psychology.</p>

<p><i>Bhavanga</i> is so called because it is an essential condition for 
continued subjective existence. </p>

<p>Whenever the mind does not receive a fresh external object, one experiences a <i>
bhavanga</i> consciousness.* Immediately after a thought-process, too, there is 
a <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness. Hence it is called <i>vīthimutta</i> - 
process-freed. Sometimes it acts as a buffer between two thought-processes . </p>

<p>Life continuum** has been suggested as the closest English equivalent. </p>

the sense are both said to be inactive&quot;. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, p. 
258.</p>

<p>** Radhakrishnan says .... Bhavanga is sub-conscious existence, or more 
accurately existence free from working consciousness, bhavanga is sub-conscious 
existence when subjectively viewed, though objectively it is sometimes taken to 
mean Nirvana Indian Philosophy, p. 408....This certainly is not the Buddhist 
conception. Bhavanga occurs in the waking consciousness too immediately after a 
citta-vīthi (thought-process). Bhavanga is never identified with Nibbāna.</p>

<p>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>bhavanga</i> arises between, </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>20. āvajjana-opening or turning towards. </b></p>

<p>When an object enters the <i>bhavanga</i> stream of consciousness the 
thought-moment that immediately follows is called <i>bhavanga-calana, (bhavanga</i>
vibration). Subsequently another thought-moment arises and is called the <i>
bhavanga-upaccheda</i>
(arresting <i>bhavanga).</i> Owing to the rapidity of the flow of <i>bhavanga</i> 
an external object does not immediately give rise to a thought-process. The 
original <i>bhavanga</i>
thought-moment perishes. Then the flow is checked. Before the actual transition 
of the <i>bhavanga</i>
it vibrates for one moment. When the <i>bhavanga</i> is arrested a 
thought-moment arises adverting the consciousness towards the object. If it is a 
physical object, the thought-moment is termed five-door cognition <i>
(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i> In the case of a mental object it is termed mind-door 
cognition <i>(manodvārāvajjana). </i></p>

<p>In the sense-door thought-process, after the <i>āvajjana</i> moment, arises 
one of the five sense-impressions. </p>

<p>See Ch. 1, N. 27. </p>

<p><i>āvajjana</i> arises between <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>pañca-viññāna</i>
(sense-impressions), and <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>javana. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>21. Pañca-viññāna</b> (sense-impressions) arise between five-door 
cognitions <i>(pañcadvārāvajjana)</i> and receiving consciousness <i>
(sampaticchana).</i>
Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and contacting are collectively termed <i>
pañca-viññāna.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>22. Sampaticchana</b> arises between five sense-impressions and 
investigating consciousness <i>(santīrana). </p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>23. Santīrana </b>arises between receiving consciousness and determining 
consciousness <i>(votthapana). </p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>24. Votthapana </b>= <i>Vi + ava +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>thā,</i> to stand, to fix, to rest, lit., thorough setting down. </p>

<p>It is at this moment that the nature of the object is fully determined. This 
is the gateway to a moral or immoral thought-process. Discrimination, rightly or 
wrongly employed at this stage, determines the thought-process either for good 
or evil. </p>

<p>There is no special class of consciousness called <i>votthapana.</i> <i>
Manodvārāvajjana</i>
(mind-door consciousness) performs the function of determining. </p>

<p><i>Votthapana</i> arises between </p>

<p>i. investigation and <i>javana,</i> and </p>

<p>ii. investigation and <i>bhavanga. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>25. Javana </b>derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ju,</i>
to run swiftly. </p>

<p>This is another important technical term which should be clearly understood. </p>

<p>Ordinarily the term is employed in the sense of swift. <i>Javanahamsa,</i>
for example, means swift swan; <i>javana-paññā</i> means swift understanding. In 
the Abhidhamma it is used in a purely technical sense. </p>

<p>Here Javana means running. It is so called because in the course of a 
thought-process it runs consecutively for seven thought-moments or five, hanging 
on to an identical object. The mental states occurring in all these thought 
moments are similar, but the potential force differs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the consciousness perceives a vivid object usually seven moments of 
Javana arise in the particular thought-process. In the case of death or when the 
Buddha performs the Twin Psychic Phenomenon <i>(Yamaka Pātihāriya)</i> only five 
thought moments arise. In the Supramundane Javana process the Path-consciousness 
arises only for one moment. </p>

<p>This javana stage is the most important from a ethical standpoint. It is at 
this psychological stage that good or evil is actually done. Irrespective of the 
desirability or the undesirability of the object presented to the mind, one can 
make the Javana process good or bad. If, for instance, one meets an enemy, a 
thought of hatred will arise almost automatically. A wise and forbearing person 
might, on the contrary, harbour a thought of love towards him. This is the 
reason why the Buddha has stated in the Dhammapada (V. 165)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;By self is evil done,</p>
            <p>By self is one defiled,</p>
            <p>By self is no evil done,</p>
            <p>By self is one purified.&quot; </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>True indeed that circumstances, habitual tendencies, environment, etc., 
condition our thoughts. Then the freewill is subordinated to the mechanistic 
course of events. There is also the possibility to overcome those external 
forces and, exercising one&#39;s own freewill, generate either good or bad thoughts. </p>

<p>A foreign element may be instrumental, but we ourselves are directly 
responsible for our own actions.</p>

<p>Of the normal seven Javana thought moments, the first is the weakest 
potentially as it lacks any previous sustaining force. The Karmic effect of this 
thought-moment may operate in this present life itself. It is called the <i>
ditthadhammavedaniya kamma.</i> If it does not operate, it becomes ineffective <i>
(ahosi).</i> The last is the second weakest, because the sustaining power is 
being spent. Its Karmic effect may operate in the immediately subsequent life <i>
(upapajjavedaniya). </i>If it does not, it also becomes ineffective. The effects 
of the remaining five may operate at any time till one attains Parinibbāna <i>
(aparāpariya-vedanīya). </i></p>

<p>It should be understood that moral and immoral <i>javanas</i> <i>
(kusalākusala)
</i>refer to the active side of life <i>(kamma-bhava).</i> They condition the 
future existence <i>(upapattibhava). </i>Apart from them there are the <i>phala*</i> 
and <i>kriyā javanas.</i> In the <i>Kriyā javanas,</i> which are experienced 
only by Buddhas and Arahats, the respective <i>cetanās</i> lack Kamma creative 
power. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[*<font SIZE="2"> Note the terrn used is <i>phala</i> (Fruit), but not <i>
vipāka.</i>
In the <i>lokuttara javana</i> process the Path-Consciousness is immedlately 
followed by the Fruit-Consciousness.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to suggest a suitable rendering for Javana. </p>

<p>&#39;&#39;Apperception&#39;&#39; is suggested by some. </p>

<p>The Dictionary of Philosophy defines apperception as &quot;the introspective or 
reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states. Leibniz, who 
introduced the term, distinguished between perception (the inner state as 
representing outer things) and apperception (the inner state as reflectively 
aware of itself). In Kant, apperception denotes the unity of self-consciousness 
pertaining to either the empirical ego (empirical apperception) or to the pure 
ego (transcendental apperception).&quot; p. 15. </p>

<p>Commenting on Javana Mrs. Rhys Davids says:- </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;I have spent many hours over Javana, and am content to throw apperception 
overboard for a better term, or for Javana, untranslated and as easy to 
pronounce as our own &#39;javelin.&#39; It suffices to remember that it is the mental 
aspect or parallel of that moment in nerve-process, when central function is 
about to become efferent activity or &#39;innervation.&#39; Teachers in Ceylon associate 
it with the word &#39;dynamic.&#39; And its dominant interest for European psychologists 
is the fusion of intellect and will in Buddhist Psychology....&quot;</p>

<p>(Compendium of Philosophy, p . 249). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Impulse is less satisfactory than even apperception. As Mrs. Rhys Davids 
suggests it is wise to retain the Pāli term. </p>

<p>See Compendium of Philosophy, pp. 42-45, 249. </p>

<p>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>javana</i> occurs between: </p>

<p>(i) <i>votthapana</i> and <i>tadārammana,</i> (ii) <i>votthapana</i>
and <i>bhavanga</i>, (iii) <i>votthapana</i> and <i>cuti,</i> (iv) <i>
manodvārāvajjana</i>
and <i>bhavanga,</i> (v) <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> and <i>cuti.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>26. Tadālambana or Tadārammana,</b> literally, means &#39;that object.&#39; 
Immediately after the Javana process two thought-moments, or none at all, arise 
having for their object the same as that of the Javana. Hence they are called <i>
tadālambana.</i>
After the <i>tadālambanas</i> again the stream of consciousness lapses into <i>
bhavanga</i>.
</p>

<p><i>Tadālambana</i> occurs between (i) <i>javana</i> and <i>bhavanga</i>
and (ii) <i>javana</i> and <i>cuti.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>27. Cuti </b>is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>cu,</i>
to depart, to be released. </p>

<p>As <i>patisandhi</i> is the initial thought-moment of life so is <i>cuti</i>
the final thought-moment. They are the entrance and exit of a particular life. <i>
Cuti</i>
functions as a mere passing away from life. <i>Patisandhi, bhavanga</i> and <i>
cuti</i> of one particular life are similar in that they possess the same object 
and identical mental co-adjuncts. </p>

<p>Death occurs immediately after the <i>cuti</i> consciousness. Though, with 
death, the physical body disintegrates and the flow of consciousness temporarily 
ceases, yet the life-stream is not annihilated as the Karmic force that propels 
it remains. Death is only a prelude to birth. </p>

<p><i>Cuti</i> occurs between (i) <i>javana</i> and <i>patisandhi,</i>
(ii) <i>tadārammana</i> and <i>patisandhi,</i> and (iii) <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>
patisandhi.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>28. Thāna, </b>lit., place, station, or occasion. Though there are 
fourteen functions yet, according to the functioning place or occasion, they are 
tenfold. The <i>pañca-viññāna</i> or the five sense-impressions are collectively 
treated as one since their functions are identical. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>29. </b>One is <i>akusala-vipāka</i> (immoral-resultant) and the other is <i>
kusala-vipāka</i> (moral-resultant). </p>

<p>Rebirth <i>(patisandhi)</i> in the animal kingdom, and in <i>peta</i>
and <i>asura</i> realms takes place with <i>upekkhāsahagata santīrana (akusala 
vipāka).</i>
<i>Bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> of that particular life are identical with this <i>
patisandhi citta. </i></p>

<p>Those human beings, who are congenitally blind, deaf, dumb, etc., have for 
their <i>patisandhi citta</i> the <i>kusala vipāka upekkhā-sahagata santīrana.</i>
Though deformity is due to an evil Kamma, yet the birth as a human is due to a 
good Kamma.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>30. </b>Namely, the <i>kāmāvacara kusala vipāka.</i> All human beings, who 
are not congenitally deformed, are born with one of these eight as their <i>
patisandhi citta.</i> </p>

<p>All these ten pertain to the <i>kāmaloka. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>31. </b>Namely, the five <i>rūpāvacara vipāka</i> and the four <i>
arūpāvacara vipāka. </p>

<p>Lokuttara</i> (Supramundane) <i>phalas</i> are not taken into consideration 
because they do not produce any rebirth.</p>

<p>Nineteen classes of consciousness, therefore, perform the triple functions of <i>
patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>32.</b> Namely, the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> (mind-door cognition) and the <i>
pañcadvārāvajjana</i> (sense-door cognition), mentioned among the 18 <i>ahetuka 
cittas.</i> The former occurs when the mind perceives a mental object, and the 
latter when it perceives a physical object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>33.</b> Namely, the ten types of moral and immoral resultant 
sense-impressions <i>(kusala-akusala vipāka pañca-viññāna). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>34.</b> Namely, the two types of receiving consciousness, accompanied by 
indifference, mentioned among the <i>ahetukas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>35. </b>Namely, the two accompanied by indifference, and one accompanied 
by pleasure. It is the first two that function as <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i>
and <i>cuti. </i></p>

<p>It should not be understood that at the moment of rebirth there is any 
investigation. One consciousness performs only one function at a particular 
time. This class of consciousness only serves as a rebirth-consciousness 
connecting the past and present births. </p>

<p>The investigating consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, occurs as a <i>
tadālambana</i>
when the object presented to the consciousness is desirable. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>36. </b>There is no special consciousness known as <i>votthapana.</i>
It is the manodvārāvajjana that serves this function in the five-door 
thought-process. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>37. </b>Namely, the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> and the <i>pañcadvārāvajjana,</i>
two of the <i>ahetuka kriya cittas.</i> As they do not enjoy the taste of the 
object they do not perform the function of Javana. The remaining <i>kriya citta,</i> 
smiling consciousness, performs the function of Javana. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>38. </b>Namely, 12 immoral + (8 + 5 + 4 + 4) 21 morals + 4 <i>lokuttara 
phalas</i> (Fruits) + (1 + 8 + 5 + 4) 18 functionals = 55. </p>

<p>The term used is not <i>vipāka</i> but <i>phala.</i> The <i>vipākas</i>
(resultants) of <i>kāma, rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa lokas</i> are not regarded as 
Javanas. The Supramundane Paths and Fruits which occur in the Javana process are 
regarded as Javanas though they exist only for a moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>39. </b>These eleven are <i>vipāka cittas</i> (resultants). When they 
perform the function of retention <i>(tadālambana), </i>there is no 
investigating function. </p>

<p>The investigating consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, performs the dual 
functions of investigating and retention. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>40.</b> In their respective planes. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>41. </b><i>Manodvārāvajjana</i>, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>42.</b> <i>Manodhātu</i> is applied to the two classes of receiving 
consciousness <i>(sampaticchana)</i> and five-door cognition<i> 
(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i>
All the remaining classes of consciousness, excluding the ten sense impressions <i>
(dvipañca-viññāna),</i>
are termed <i>mano-viññāna dhātu.</i></p>

<p>46. The commentary sums up 46 as follows:-</b></p>

<p>(a) 1; (b) 2 <i>(akusala </i>and <i>kusala vipāka sampaticchana);</i>
(c) 2 <i>(akusala </i>and <i>kusala</i> <i>vipāka sampaticchana);</i> (d) 3 <i>
(akusala vipāka </i>= 1, <i>kusala vipāka santīrana</i> = 2), (e) 1; (f) 29 <i>
(akusala </i>= 12 + kusala = 8 + <i>ahetuka kriyā hasituppāda</i> = 1 + <i>
sobhana</i> <i>kriyā</i> = 8); (g) 8<i> (sobhana vipāka </i>- the other three 
being included in <i>santīrana). </i></p>

<p>1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 29 + 8 = 46</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forty-six types of consciousness arise through the eye-door with material 
form as the object<i> (rūpālambana).</i> An equal number arises in the remaining 
four physical doors with their respective objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. Accordingly, yathāraham -</b></p>

<p>That is, &quot;according as the object is desirable or not, as attentiveness is 
right or wrong, as passion-freed individuals or not&quot; (Vibhāvini Tīkā). Mr. Aung 
says Ledi Sayadaw explains the same by &#39;According to the object, the plane of 
existence, the subject, attention, etc.&#39; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>48. </b>All types of kāmāvacara consciousness arise through these five 
doors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>49. </b>Namely, 12 <i>akusalas</i> + 1 <i>ahetuka kriyā</i> + 16 <i>
sobhana kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> + 10 <i>rūpāvacara kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> 
+ 8 <i>arūpāvacara kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> + 8 <i>lokuttara</i> <i>magga</i> 
and <i>phala.</i> (12 + 1 + 16 + l0 + 8 + 8 = 55)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>50. </b>Namely, 3 <i>santīranas</i> and 8 <i>sobhana vipākas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>51.</b> <b>Dvāra-vimutta,</b> door-freed. </p>

<p>Vibhāvini Tīkā explains that they are so called because (i) they do not arise 
in any of the sense-doors such as eye etc., (ii) <i>bhavanga</i> itself is the 
mind-door, and (iii) they exist without receiving any new external object 
(pertaining to the present life). </p>

<p>The first reason applies to <i>cuti</i> and <i>patisandhi,</i> the second to <i>
bhavangupaccheda,</i> and the third to all <i>bhavanga</i>s and <i>cuti. </i></p>

<p>It was stated earlier that <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i>
of a particular life are similar because their objects and their co-adjuncts are 
identical although their functions differ. </p>

<p>At the moment of death a thought-process that conditions the future existence 
occurs. The object of this thought-process may be (i) a Kamma (action) which one 
has performed in the course of one&#39;s life. One recollects the deed as if being 
renewed. Strictly speaking, it is a recurring of the consciousness which one has 
experienced while performing the action. Or it may be (ii) any symbol <i>
(kamma-nimitta) </i>which was conspicuous during the performance of the action. 
It may also be (iii) characteristic symbol of the place in which one is bound to 
be reborn<i> (gati nimitta)*</i>. Taking one of these three as the object, the 
rebirth-consciousness takes place in the future existence. The object of the <i>
bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> of that particular existence is similar to that of 
the <i>patisandhi.</i> Hence it was stated above that they do not take any new 
external object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[* Referring to the object of the <i>patisandhi citta</i> Mr. Aung says in 
the Compendium - &quot;These have for their object either the past efficient action 
itself, or a symbol of that past action <i>(kamma-nimitta), </i>or a sign of the 
tendencies <i>(gati-nimitta)</i> that are determined by the force of that past 
action&quot; - p. 26. Here <i>gati-nimitta</i> means a sign or symbol of the place in 
which he is to be born, such as fire, flesh, celestial mansions, etc.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>52. </b>They arise in their respective doors such as eye, ear, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>53. </b>All the 26 Sublime and Supramundane javanas arise through the 
mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>54.</b> The two <i>sampaticchana</i> and <i>pañcadvārāvajjana</i>
arise only through the five physical sense-doors. </p>

<p>Readers should note that at times all these three types of consciousness are 
collectively termed <i>manodhātuttika</i> (three mind-elements). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>55. </b>Pleasurable investigation arises through the five physical doors 
when the object presented is desirable. It occurs through the mind-door as a <i>
tadālambana.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>56. </b>This is the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> which functions purely as a 
mind-door apprehending consciousness and as a determining consciousness in a 
thought-process which arises through any of the five physical doors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>57.</b> When they function as <i>patisandhi, bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i>
they are door-freed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>58. </b>The nine <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara vipāka cittas</i> 
arise as <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> respective planes. 
Hence they are door-freed.</p>

<p>(v. Summary of Objects)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 10. In the summary of objects (60) there are six kinds-namely, visible 
object (61), audible object (62), odorous object (63), sapid object (64), 
tangible object (65), and cognizable object (66). </p>

<p>Therein form itself is visible object. Likewise sound and so forth are the 
audible objects etc. But cognizable object is sixfold: - sensitive (parts of 
organs) (67) subtle matter (68), consciousness (69), mental states (70), Nibbāna 
(71), and concepts (72).</p>

<p>To all types of eye-door consciousness visible form itself is the object. 
That too pertains only to the present (73). Likewise sounds and so forth of the 
ear-door consciousness and so forth also pertain to the present (74). </p>

<p>But the six kinds of objects of the mind-door consciousness are accordingly 
(75) present, past, future, and independent of time. </p>

<p>(76) To the &#39;door-freed&#39; such as relinking, <i>bhavanga</i>, and decease any 
of the afore-said six becomes objects as they arise. They are grasped, mostly 
(77) through the six doors, pertaining to the immediately preceding life, as 
past or present object or as concepts. They are (technically) known as Kamma, a 
symbol of Kamma,&#39; or a symbol of the state of rebirth.&#39;*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[*Mr. Aung translates this passages as follows:......</p>

<p>&quot;Further, the objects of those &#39;door-freed&#39; classes of consciousness which 
are called rebirth, life-continuum, and re-decease cognitions, are also of six 
kinds according to circumstances. They have usually been grasped (as object) in 
the immediately preceding existence by way of the six doors, they are objects of 
things either present or past, or they are concepts. And they are (technically) 
known as &#39;Karma&#39;, &#39;sign of Karma&#39;, or &#39;sign of destiny&#39;. Compendium of 
Philosophy&#39; p. 120.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of them eye-consciousness and so forth have respectively form and so forth as 
their single object. But the three mind-elements have five objects such as form 
and so forth. The remaining Sense-sphere Resultants and the smiling 
consciousness have wholly Sense-sphere objects. </p>

<p>The Immorals and the Javanas, dissociated with knowledge, have all objects 
except the Supramundane objects (78). </p>

<p>The Sense-sphere Morals and the super-intellect (79) consciousness, known as 
the fifth jhāna, have all objects except the Path and Fruit of Arahatship</p>

<p>The Sense sphere Functionals, associated with knowledge, super-intellect 
Function al consciousness (80 ) and the determining consciousness (81) have in 
all cases all kinds of objects (82). </p>

<p>(83) Amongst the <i>arūpa</i> consciousness the second and fourth have 
Sublime objects. All the remaining sublime types of consciousness have concepts 
(84 ) as objects. The Supramundane types of consciousness have Nibbāna as their 
object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 11. Twenty-five (85) types of consciousness are connected with lower 
objects (86); six (87) with the Sublime; twenty-one (88) with concepts (89); 
eight with Nibbāna. </p>

<p>Twenty (90) are connected with all objects except the Supramundane objects; 
five (91) in all except with the Highest Path and Fruit; and six (92) with all. </p>

<p>Sevenfold is their grouping. </p>

<p>Notes: - </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>60. ārāmmanam or ālambanam -</b></p>

<p><i>ārāmmanam</i> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
ram,</i> to attach, to adhere, to delight. </p>

<p><i>ālambanam</i> is derived from<i> ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
lamb,</i> to hang upon. </p>

<p>That on which the subject hangs, or adheres to, or delights in, is <i>
ārammana</i>
or <i>ālambana.</i> It means an object. </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma there are six kinds of objects, which may be 
classified as physical and mental. </p>

<p>Each sense has its corresponding object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>61. Rūpa</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>rup,</i>
to change, to perish. In its generic sense it means&#39; that which changes its 
colour owing to cold, heat, etc.&#39; <i>(sītunhādivasena vannavikāramāpajjatī&#39; ti 
rūpam). </i></p>

<p>Abhidhamma enumerates 28 kinds of <i>rūpa,</i> which will be descriptively 
dealt with in a special chapter. Here the term is used in its specific sense of 
object of sight. </p>

<p>The Vibhāvini Tīkā states, &quot;<i>Rūpa</i> is that which manifests itself by 
assuming a difference in colour, that which expresses the state of having 
penetrated into the heart.&quot; <i>(vannavikāram āpajjamānam rūpayati 
hadayangatabhāvam pakāsetī&#39; ti rūpam). </i></p>

<p><i>Rūpa</i> is the abode, range, field, or sphere of colour <i>(vannāyatana).</i>
It is the embodiment of colour. </p>

<p>It should be understood that according to Abhidhamma <i>rūpa</i>
springs from four sources - namely, Kamma, mind <i>(citta), </i>seasonal 
phenomena <i>(utu),</i>
and food <i>(āhāra). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>62. Sadda </b>or (sound) arises from the friction of elements of extension <i>
(pathavī dhātu).</i> There are four material elements <i>(bhūta rūpa)</i>
- namely, the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> the element of cohesion <i>
(āpo), </i>the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> and the element of motion <i>
(vāyo). </i>These are the fundamental units of matter. They are always 
inter-dependent and inter-related. One element may preponderate over the other 
as, for example, the element of extension predominates in earth, the element of 
cohesion in water, the element of heat in fire, and the element of motion in 
air. </p>

<p>When an element of extension collides with a similar element there arises 
sound. It springs from both mind <i>(citta) </i>and seasonal phenomena <i>(utu). </i></p>

<p>Sounds are either articulate<i> (vykata) </i>or inarticulate <i>(avyākata).
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>63. Gandha</b> (odour) is derived from <i>gandh,</i> to express<i>
(sūcane).</i> It springs from all the four sources. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>64. Rasa</b> (taste) is diffused in all the elements. Only the sapidity 
that exists in them is regarded as <i>rasa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>65. Photthabbārammana </b>- tangible object. It is not mere contact. With 
the exception of the element of cohesion all the remaining three elements are 
regarded as tangible, because the former cannot be felt by the body. </p>

<p>When these three elements, which constitute a tangible object, collide with 
the sensory surface of the body there arises either pain or pleasure according 
to the desirability or undesirability of the object. In the case of other 
objects there results only <i>upekkhā</i> - neutral feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>66. Dhammārammana </b>includes all objects of consciousness. <i>Dhamma</i>
embraces both mental and physical phenomena. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>67.</b> The sensory surfaces of all the five organs are known as <i>
pasāda.</i>
In the case of eye, ear, nose, tongue the sensory surfaces are located in 
particular spots, while the sensory surface of the body pervades the whole 
system.</p>

<p>There are five kinds of <i>pasāda rūpa</i> corresponding to the five 
sense-organs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>68. Sukhuma rūpa -</b></p>

<p>Of the 28 kinds of <i>rūpa</i> 16 are classed as <i>sukhuma</i>
(subtle) and 12 as <i>odārika</i> (gross).</p>

<p>The physical objects of (i) sight, (ii) hearing, (iii) scent, (iv) taste, and 
touch (which includes the element of (v) extension, (vi) heat, (vii) and 
motion), and the five <i>pasāda rūpas</i> belong to the gross group. The 
remaining 16 which will be described in the chapter on <i>rūpa,</i> belong to 
the subtle group. They are termed subtle as there is no collision on their part. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>69.</b> Namely, all the 89 types of consciousness. They are sometimes 
collectively treated as one object as they all possess the identical 
characteristic of awareness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>70.</b> Namely, the 52 mental properties. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>71.</b> This is a supramundane object which is perceived by the eight 
kinds of Supramundane consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>72. Paññatti</b> is that which is made manifest. It is twofold-namely, <i>
nāma paññatti</i> and <i>attha paññatti.</i> The former means a name or term 
such as chair, table, etc., the latter means the object or idea conveyed 
thereby. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>73.</b> What is time? Strictly speaking, it is a mere concept which does 
not exist in an absolute sense. On the other hand what space is to matter, time 
is to mind. Conventionally we speak of past <i>(atīta),</i> present<i> 
(paccuppanna), </i>and future <i>(anāgata). </i></p>

<p>Past is defined as that which has gone beyond its own state or the moments of 
genesis, development, and cessation <i>(attano sabhāvam uppādādikkhanam vā atītā 
atikkantā atītā). </i></p>

<p>Present is that which on account of this and that reason enters, goes, exists 
above the moments of genesis etc. <i>(tam tam kāranam paticca uppādādikkhanam 
uddham pannā, gatā, pavattā = paccuppannā). </i></p>

<p>Future is that which has not yet reached both states <i>(tadubhayam&#39; pi na 
āgatā sampattā). </i></p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma each consciousness consists of three phases - <i>
uppāda</i>
(genesis), <i>thiti</i> (development), and <i>bhanga</i> (dissolution or 
cessation). In the view of some commentators there is no intermediate <i>thiti</i> 
stage but only the stages of arising and passing away. Each thought-moment is 
followed by another. Time is thus the <i>sine qua non</i> of the succession of 
mental states. The fundamental unit of time is the duration of a thought-moment. 
Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleeting thought moments is such 
that within the brief duration of a flash of lightning there may be billions of 
thought-moments. </p>

<p>Matter, which also constantly changes, endures only for seventeen 
thought-moments, being the time duration for one thought-process. </p>

<p>Past is gone, Future has not come. We live only for one thought-moment and 
that slips into the irrevocable past. In one sense there is only the eternal 
NOW. In another sense the so-called present is the transitional stage from the 
future to the past.
</p>

<p>The Dictionary of Philosophy defines time &quot;as the general medium in which all 
events take place in succession or appear to take place in succession.&quot; </p>

<p>Atthasālini states that time is a concept derived from this or that 
phenomenon. And it does not exist in reality; it is merely a concept. <i>(Tam 
tam upādāya paññatto kālo nāma. So pan&#39; esa sabhāvato avaijjamānattā 
paññatti-mattako eva). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>74. </b>All sense-objects belong to the present. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>75. </b>Accordingly - <i>yathāraham,</i> i.e., with respect to 
sense-sphere Javana, Higher Intellect <i>(abhiññā) </i>and other Sublime 
Javanas. </p>

<p>The six kinds of objects of the Sense-sphere Javanas, with the exception of 
smiling consciousness, are present, past, future, and independent of time. </p>

<p>The objects of the smiling consciousness are past, present, and future.
</p>

<p>The objects of the Javanas, by means of which the Higher Intellect such as 
Divine Eye, Divine Ear are developed, are past, present, future, and independent 
of time. </p>

<p>The objects of sublime Javanas may be either timeless or past. </p>

<p>As Nibbāna is eternal it does not belong to the past, present, or future. It 
is timeless. So is <i>paññatti,</i> independent of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>76.</b> This difficult passage needs some explanation.</p>

<p>When a person is about to die he sometimes recollects a good or bad action he 
has performed during his lifetime. The moral or immoral consciousness, 
experienced at the particular moment, arises now as a fresh consciousness This 
is technically known as &#39;Kamma&#39;. </p>

<p>Being a thought, it is a <i>dhammārammana</i> grasped through the mind-door, 
and is past.</p>

<p>The object of the <i>patisandhi, bhavanga,</i> and <i>cuti</i> classes of 
consciousness of the subsequent life is this <i>dhammārammana</i>. </p>

<p>At times it may be a sign or symbol associated with the good or bad action. 
It may be one of the five physical objects viewed through one of the six doors, 
as a present or past object. </p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, one hears the Dhamma at the dying moment. In this case 
the present audible word grasped through the ear becomes the object. It, 
therefore, follows that the object of the afore-said three classes of 
consciousness of the following life becomes this <i>kamma nimitta. </i></p>

<p>Again, let us think that a dying physician sees through his mental eye the 
patients he has treated. Now this is a past <i>rūpārammana</i> perceived through 
the mind-door. </p>

<p>Or again, let us think that a dying butcher hears the groans of cattle he has 
killed. The past audible object is presented to the person through the 
mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Kamma-nimitta</b> may, therefore, be past or present, viewed through one 
of the six doors. In some cases some symbol of the place in which he is to be 
reborn such as fire, flesh, celestial mansions, etc. may appear to the dying 
person. This is regarded as present object grasped through the mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Gati-nimitta</b> is, therefore, a visual object, present in point of time, 
and is perceived through the mind-door. </p>

<p>It should be noted that the <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i>, and <i>cuti</i>
thought-moments of the Sense-sphere have for their objects a <i>kamma,</i> a <i>
kamma-nimitta,</i>
or a <i>gati-nimitta,</i> perceived through one of the six-doors, in the 
immediately preceding life. </p>

<p>In the case of all <i>rūpāvacara patisandhi</i> etc., the object is always a 
past <i>kamma-nimitta</i> which is a concept <i>(paññatti)</i> such as a <i>
kasina</i>
symbol, perceived through the mind door. </p>

<p>The object of the first and third <i>arūpa patisandhi</i> etc., is also a 
past concept <i>(paññatti)</i> such as <i>&#39;ananto ākāso&#39;</i> &#39;infinite is space&#39; 
in the case of the first, and the concept <i>&#39;natthi kiñci&#39;</i>-&#39;there is 
nothing,&#39; in the case of the third. These two concepts are regarded as <i>
kamma-nimittas</i>
perceived through the mind-door. </p>

<p>The object of the second and fourth <i>arūpa jhāna patisandhi</i>
etc., is a past mental object which serves as the <i>kamma-nimitta</i> perceived 
through the mind-door. </p>

<p>As was explained in the first chapter the second <i>arūpa</i>
consciousness was developed by taking the first <i>arūpa</i> consciousness as 
the object, and the fourth with the third as the object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>77.</b> The term <i>&#39;yebhuyyena&#39;</i> (mostly) is used to indicate the 
rebirth of one born in the <i>asañña</i> plane where there is no consciousness. 
The commentary states that by the power of Kamma some object such as a <i>
kamma-nimitta</i>
presents itself to the <i>patisandhi</i> consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>78. </b>In Buddhism an ordinary worldling is called a <i>puthujjana</i>
(lit., manyfolk or one who is born again and again). Those who have attained the 
first three stages of Sainthood are called <i>sekhas</i> (lit., those who 
undergo a training). Those who have attained the Final stage of Sainthood 
(Arahatship) are called <i>asekhas,</i>
who no more undergo any training. </p>

<p>The <b>sekhas</b> cannot comprehend the Path and Fruit consciousness of an 
Arahat because they have not attained that superior state, but worldly thoughts 
of an Arahat they can. </p>

<p>Similarly the worldlings cannot comprehend the supramundane consciousness of 
the <i>Sekha</i> Saints. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>79. Abhiññā</b> are the five kinds of Higher Knowledge. They are Divine 
Eye <i>(dibbacakkhu),</i> Divine Ear <i>(dibbasota), </i>Reminiscence of past 
births <i>(pubbenivāsānussati ñāna), </i>Reading the thoughts of others <i>
(paracittavijānana)
</i>and Psychic Powers <i>(iddhividha ñāna). </i>To develop these five <i>
abhiññas</i>
one must possess the fifth Jhāna. Not even with this developed Sublime 
consciousness can a worldling or a <i>Sekha</i> comprehend the Path and Fruit 
consciousness of an Arahat. </p>

<p>It is only an Arahat who can comprehend the Path and Fruit consciousness of 
an Arahat. </p>

<p>A detailed account of <i>abhiññā</i> will appear in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>80.</b> These two classes of consciousness are experienced only by 
Arahats. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>81.</b> This is the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> which occurs before every 
Javana process. Hence there is nothing that is beyond the scope of this 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>82.</b> Namely, Sense-sphere objects, Sublime objects, Supramundane 
objects, and concepts <i>(paññatti). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>83.</b> The object of the second <i>arūpa</i> consciousness is the first <i>
arūpa</i> consciousness, while that of the fourth is the third. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>84. </b>i.e., the object of the first <i>arūpa</i> consciousness is the 
concept <i>&#39;ananto ākāso&#39;</i> &#39;infinite is space,&#39; that of the third is the 
concept <i>&#39;natthi kiñci&#39;</i> there is nothing.&#39; </p>

<p>An explanation of these appears in the first chapter, </p>

<p>All the <i>rūpa jhānas</i> have concepts such as <i>kasinas</i> as their 
objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>85.</b> Namely, 23 Sense-sphere Resultants + 1 sense-door consciousness + 
1 smiling consciousness = 25. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>86. Paritta,</b> derived from <i>pari +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>dā,</i> to break, to shorten, means lower or inferior. This refers to 
Sense-sphere objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>87.</b> Namely, the Moral, Resultant, and Functional 2nd and 4th <i>arūpa 
cittas</i> <i>(viññānāñcāyatana </i>and <i>n&#39;eva saññā n&#39;āsaññāyatana). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>88.</b> Namely, 16 <i>rūpa jhānas</i> and Moral, Resultant, and Functional 
1st and 3rd <i>arūpa jhānas (ākāsānañcāyatana</i> and <i>ākiñcaññāyatana);</i>
15 + 6 = 21.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>89. Vohāra </b>here refers to concepts such as <i>kasinas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>90.</b> Namely, the 12 Immorals and 8 Sense-sphere Morals and Functionals, 
dissociated with knowledge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>91.</b> They are the 4 Sense-sphere Morals associated with knowledge and 
the 5th Moral <i>rūpa jhāna (abhiññā kusala citta). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>92.</b> They are the 4 Sense-sphere Functionals, 5th Functional <i>rūpa

<p>(vi. Summary of Bases)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 12. In the summary of bases (93), there are six kinds-namely, eye, ear, 
nose, tongue, body, and heart. </p>

<p>All these, too, (94) are found in the Sense-sphere. But in the Form-sphere 
three bases - nose, tongue, and body - are not found (96). In the 
Formless-sphere no base (96) exists. </p>

<p>Therein the five elements of sense-impressions lie entirely dependent on the 
five sensory parts (97) of the organs as their respective bases. But the 
mind-element - namely, the five-door adverting consciousness and the (two types 
of) receiving consciousness - rest in dependence on the heart (98). Likewise the 
remaining mind-conscious-element (99) comprising the (100) investigating 
consciousness, the great Resultants, the two (101) accompanied by aversion, the 
first Path (192) consciousness, smiling consciousness (103), and Form-sphere 
(104) consciousness, rest in dependence on the heart (105). </p>

<p>(10 + 3 + 3 + 8 +2 + 1 + 1 + 15 = 43)</p>

<p>The remaining classes of consciousness (106) whether Moral, Immoral, 
Functional, or Supramundane, are either dependent on, or independent of, the 
heart-base. The Formless-sphere Resultants are independent of the heart-base. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 13. It should be known that in the Sense-sphere seven elements (107) are 
dependent on the six bases, in the Form sphere four (108) are dependent on three 
(109) bases, in the Formless-sphere the one single (110) mind-element is not</p>

<p>dependent on any.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forty-three arise dependent on a base. Forty-two arise with or without a 
base. The formless Resultants arise without any base. </p>

<p>Thus ends the third chapter in the compendium of Abhidhamma, entitled the 
Miscellaneous Treatment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>93. Vatthu </b>is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vas,</i>
to dwell. In its primary sense it means a garden, field, or avenue. In its 
secondary sense it means a cause or condition. <i>Vatthu</i> is also applied to 
something that exists, that is, a substance, object, or thing. Referring to the 
three objects of worship, the Buddha says <i>&quot;Uddesikam ti avatthukam.&quot;</i> Here <i>
avatthuka</i> means objectless, without a thing or substance. </p>

<p>Vatthu is the seat of sense-organs. </p>

<p>There are six seats of physical bases corresponding to the six senses. </p>

<p>These will be fully described in the chapter on <i>rūpa.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>94.</b> The indeclinable particle <i>&#39;pi&#39;</i> (too) in the text indicates 
that there is an exception in the case of those who are born blind, deaf, dumb, 
etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>95.</b> The organs exist, but not their sensory faculties as beings in 
these higher planes have temporarily inhibited the desire for sensual pleasures <i>
(kāmarāga).</i>
They possess eye and ear so that they may utilize them for good purposes. The 
heart-base also exists because it is the seat of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>96.</b> Being devoid of all forms of matter. Mind alone exists even 
without the seat of consciousness by the power of meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>97. </b>For instance, the eye-consciousness depends on the sensory surface 
of the eye but not on the physical organ or &#39;eye of flesh.&#39; The other 
sense-impressions also depend on their respective sensory surfaces. </p>

<p>The sensory surfaces <i>(pasāda)</i> of these five organs should be 
understood as follows: -</p>

<p><b>&quot;Cakkhu&quot;</b> which stands for vision, sense of sight and eye. &quot;Eye,&quot; 
however, is always in the present work to be understood as the seeing faculty or 
visual sense, and not as the physical or &#39;eye of flesh&#39; <i>(mamsa cakkhu).</i> 
The commentary gives an account of the eye, of which the following is the 
substance: First the aggregate organism <i>(sasambhāra-cakkhu):</i> a ball of 
flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by the socket bone beneath and by the bone of the 
eyebrow above, by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within and by 
the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, the 
six attributes dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form <i>
(santhānam),</i> and collocation <i>(sambhavo);
</i>vitality, sex, body-sensibility <i>(kāyappasādo),</i> and the visual 
sentient organ. The last four have their source in kamma. When &#39;the world, 
seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it only 
perceives the basis (or seat-<i>vatthu)</i>
of the eye. And this ball of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibers, is 
white, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent and the 
gaseous. It is white by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red 
by superfluity of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by 
superfluity of the liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent, quivering by 
superfluity of the gaseous. But that sentient organ <i>(pasādo)</i>
which is there bound, inherent, derived from the four great principles - this is 
the visual sense <i>(pasāda-cakkhu).</i> Placed in the midst and in the front of 
the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding it (note that 
the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the &#39;black disc&#39;) and in the 
circle of vision, in the region where the forms of adjacent bodies come to 
appear, it permeates the seven ocular membranes as sprinkled oil will permeate 
seven cotton wicks. And so it stands, aided by the four elements, sustaining, 
maturing, moving (samudīranam) - like an infant prince and four nurses, feeding, 
bathing, dressing, and fanning him - maintained by nutriment both physical <i>
(utu)</i> and mental, protected by the (normal) span of life, invested with 
colour, smell, taste, and so forth, in size the measure of a louse&#39;s head - 
stands duly constituting itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions etc. 
For as it has been said by the Commander of the Doctrine (Sāriputta): </p>

<p>&#39;The visual sense by which he beholds forms</p>

<p>Is small and delicate, comparable to a louse&#39;s head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Sotappasāda -</b></p>

<p>&quot;This, situated within the cavity of the aggregate organism of the ear, and 
well-furnished fine reddish hairs, is in shape like a little finger-stall <i>
(angulivethana).&quot;</i>
(Asl. 310).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Ghānappasāda -</b></p>

<p>&quot;This is situated inside the cavity of the aggregate nasal organism, in 
appearance like a goat&#39;s hoof.&quot; (Asl. 310). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Jivhāppasāda -</b></p>

<p>This is situated above the middle of the aggregate gustatory organism, in 
appearance like the upper side of the leaf of a lotus.&quot; (Asl. 310). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Kāyappasāda -</b></p>

<p>&quot;The sphere of kāya - so runs the comment (Asl. 311) - is diffused over the 
whole bodily form just as oil pervades an entire cotton rag.&quot; </p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, pp. 173-181). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>98. Hadayavatthu </b>- heart-base. </p>

<p>According to the commentators, <i>hadayavatthu</i> is the seat of 
consciousness. Tradition says that within the cavity of the heart there is some 
blood, and depending on which lies the seat of consciousness. It was this 
cardiac theory that prevailed in the Buddha&#39;s time, and this was evidently 
supported by the Upanishads. </p>

<p>The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit 
Himself. </p>

<p>Mr. Aung in his Compendium argues that the Buddha was silent on this point. 
He did not positively assert that the seat of consciousness was either in the 
heart or in the brain. In the Dhammasangani the term <i>hadayavatthu</i> has 
purposely been omitted. In the Patthāna, instead of using hadaya as the seat of 
consciousness, the Buddha has simply stated <i>&#39;yam rūpain nissāya&#39;</i> - 
&#39;depending on that <i>rūpa.&#39;</i>
Mr. Aung&#39;s opinion is that the Buddha did not want to reject the popular theory. 
Nor did He advance a new theory that brain is the seat of consciousness as is 
regarded by modern scientists. </p>

<p>See Buddhist Psychology - Introduction lxxviii, and Compendium of Philosophy, 
pp. 277-279. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>99. Dhātu</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dhar,</i>
to hold, to bear. &#39;That which carries its own characteristic mark is <i>dhātu.</i> 
They are so called since they are devoid of being or life <i>(nissatta nijjīva). </i></p>

<p>For the sake of convenience three technical terms are used here. They are <i>
pañca-viññāna-dhātu, manodhātu, mano-viññāna-dhātu.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Pañca-viññāna-dhātu</i> is applied to the ten sense-impressions. </p>

<p><i>Mano-dhātu </i>- is applied to the two types of receiving consciousness 
and five-door adverting consciousness<i> (sampaticchana</i> and <i>
pañcadvārāvajjana).</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mano-viññāna-dhātu</i> is applied to all the remaining classes of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>100. </b>The three classes of investigating consciousness and the eight 
great Resultants do not arise in the Formless sphere owing to the absence of any 
door or any function there. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>101.</b> As aversion has been inhibited by, those born in <i>rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i> planes the two classes of consciousness, accompanied by 
aversion, do not arise there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>102.</b> To attain the first stage of Sainthood one must hear the word 
from another <i>(paratoghosappaccaya). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>103.</b> Smiling consciousness cannot arise without a body. Buddhas and 
Pacceka Buddhas who experience such classes of consciousness are not born 
outside the human plane. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>104.</b> No <i>rūpa jhāna</i> consciousness arises in the <i>arūpaloka</i>
as those persons born in such planes have temporarily inhibited the desire for <i>
rūpa.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>105. </b>All the 43 types of consciousness, stated above, are dependent on 
the <i>hadayavatthu. </i></p>

<p>(10 + 3 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 15 = 43) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>106.</b> They are the 8 <i>sobhana kusalas,</i> 4 <i>rūpa kusalas,</i>
10 <i>akusalas,</i> 1 <i>manodvārāvajjana,</i> 8 <i>sobhana kriyā,</i> 4 <i>
arūpa kriyā,</i> 7 <i>lokuttaras</i> = 42. </p>

<p>These may arise in planes with the five Aggregates or in planes with four 
Aggregates <i>(arūpa-loka). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>107.</b> i.e., 5 <i>pañca-viññāna-dhātus</i> + 1 <i>manodhātu</i>
+ 1 <i>mano-viññāna-dhātu</i> = 7. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>108.</b> i.e., 1 <i>cakkhu-viññāna,</i> 1 <i>sota-viññāna</i>, 1 <i>
mano-dhātu,</i> 1 <i>mano-viññāna-dhātu</i> = 4. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>109.</b> Namely, <i>cakkhu, sota</i> and <i>hadayavatthu. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>110.</b> Dhātu + eka = Dhātv&#39; eka. This refers to <i>mano-viññāna-dhātu.</i>

<p>Five Sense-Door Thought-process</b></font></p>
<b>

<p>Introductory</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. Having thus completed the noble compendium of consciousness and its 
concomitants (with respect to feelings etc.), I shall briefly describe, in due 
order, the compendium of (thought) processes in lifetime, according to the 
planes and individuals, and as they are determined by what (consciousness) that 
precedes and by what that follows (1) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. In the preceding chapter states of consciousness and mental concomitants 
were treated according to feelings, roots, etc. In the present one the author 
deals with thought processes as they arise through the mind and the other five 
senses, in accordance with the different kinds of individuals and planes of 
existence. </p>

<p>The Pāli phrase <i>pubbāparaniyāmitam</i> needs an explanation. The 
commentary explains it thus - this <i>citta</i> arises after so many <i>cittas,</i> 
and so many <i>cittas</i> follow this <i>citta (idam ettakehi param, imassa 
anantaram, ettakāni cittāni). </i></p>

<p><i>Patisandhi</i> here refers to the initial thought-process that occurs at 
the moment of conception in a new birth. <i>Pavatti</i> refers to all

<p>Thought-Processes</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 2. In the compendium of thought-processes six kinds of six classes each 
should be understood - namely, </p>

<p>i. six bases, ii. six doors, iii. six objects*, iv. six-fold consciousness, 
v. six processes (2), and vi. sixfold presentation of objects (3) </p>

<p>The presentation of objects to the process-freed consciousness** is threefold 
- namely, (i) Kamma, (ii) Kamma sign, and (iii) Destiny sign. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[* These first three classes have already been discused in the previous 
chapter. They are repeated hero merely to complete the six groups.]</p>

<p>[** Namely, <i>patisandhi, bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti.</i>]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bases, doors, and objects, therein, are as described before. </p>

<p>The sixfold types of consciousness are eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, 
nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and 
mind-consciousness. </p>

<p>According to the doors the thought-processes are:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The process connected with the eye-door, </p>
    <p>2. The process connected with the ear-door, </p>
    <p>3. The process connected with the nose-door, </p>
    <p>4. The process connected with the tongue-door, </p>
    <p>5. The process connected with the body-door, and </p>
    <p>6. The process connected with the mind-door. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to consciousness the thought-processes are: -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The process connected with the eye-consciousness </p>

<p>2. The process connected with the ear-consciousness </p>

<p>3. The process connected with the nose consciousness,</p>

<p>4. The process connected with the tongue-consciousness,</p>

<p>5. The process connected with the body-consciousness, and </p>

<p>6. The process connected with the mind consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The thought-procedure connected with the doors should thus be co-ordinated. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. The sixfold presentation of objects (4) should be understood as 
follows:-</p>

<p>a. At the five sense doors -</p>

<p>(i) &#39;very great,&#39; (ii) &#39;great,&#39; (iii) &#39;slight,&#39; (iv) &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p>b. At the mind door -</p>

<p>(v) &#39;clear&#39; and (vi) &#39;obscure.&#39; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How is the intensity of objects be determined? </p>

<p>The three instants such as genesis, static (or development), and dissolution 
constitute one thought-moment. The duration of material things consists of 
seventeen such thought-moments. </p>

<p>The five sense-objects enter the avenue of five sense doors at the static 
stage when one or several thought moments have passed. </p>

<p>Hence the thought-process (4) runs as follows: -</p>

<p>Suppose a visible object which has passed one instant (i) enters the avenue 
of eye. Then the <i>bhavanga-</i>consciousness vibrates for one moment and 
perishes, (ii, iii) arresting the <i>bhavanga</i> stream. Subsequently the 
five-door apprehending consciousness (iv) arises and ceases apprehending that 
very visible object. </p>

<p>Thereafter the following thought-moments arise and cease in order -</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(v) eye-consciousness seeing that very form,</p>
        <p>(vi) recipient consciousness receiving it,</p>
        <p>(vii) investigating consciousness investigating it, </p>
        <p>(viii) determining consciousness determining it. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then any one of the 29 kinds of sense-sphere <i>javanas</i>, thus causally 
conditioned, runs mostly for seven moments (ix - xv).</p>

<p>Following the javanas two retentive resultants (xvi, xvii) arise accordingly. 
Finally comes the subsidence into the <i>bhavanga</i>. </p>

<p>Thus far seventeen thought-moments are complete, namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>fourteen &#39;thought-arisings&#39; <i>(cittuppāda) </p>
        </i><p>two vibrations of <i>bhavanga,</i> and </p>
        <p>one thought-moment that passed at t he inception.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the object ceases. </p>

<p>Such an object is termed &#39;very great.&#39; (<font SIZE="2">See pp. 231, 232.)</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That object which enters the avenue of sense, having passed (a few moments) 
and is not able to survive till the arising of the retentive thought-moments, is 
termed &#39;great. &#39; </p>

<p>That object which enters the avenue of sense, having passed (a few moments) 
and is not able to survive even till - the arising of the javanas, is termed 
&#39;slight.&#39;</p>

<p>In that case even the javanas do not arise, but only the determining 
consciousness lasts for two or three moments and then there is subsidence into 
bhavanga.</p>

<p>That object which is about to cease and which enters the avenue of sense, 
having passed a few moments and is not able to survive till the arising of 
determining consciousness, is termed &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p>In that case there is merely a vibration of the <i>bhavanga,</i> but no 
genesis of a thought-process.</p>

<p>As the eye-door so is in the ear-door etc. </p>

<p>In all the five doors, the fourfold presentation of objects should be 
understood, in due order, in the four ways, known as -</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. the course (ending with) retention.</p>
    <p>2. the course (ending with) javana. </p>
    <p>3. the course (ending with) determining, and</p>
    <p>4. the futile course. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>§ 4. There are seven modes* and fourteen different types of consciousness in 
the thought-process. In detail there are accordingly 54** in the five doors. </p>

<p>Herein this is the method of thought-process in the five sense-doors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[* Namely, 1. <i>āvajjana,</i> 2. <i>pañca viññāna,</i> 3. <i>sampaticchana,</i>
4. <i>santīrana,</i> 5. <i>votthapana,</i> 6. <i>javana,</i> (7 moments) and 7. <i>
tadālambana.</i>
These become 14 when the 7 <i>javana</i> moments and 2 <i>tadālambanas</i> are 
reckoned separately.]</font></p>

<p>[** <font SIZE="2">These comprise all the classes of Sense-sphere 
consciousness which arise through the five sense-doors.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2. Vīthi</b> is derived from <i>vi +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>i,</i> to go. </p>

<p>This term means a way or street, but here it is used in the sense of process <i>
(paramparā).</i> A thought-process consists of several thought-moments, and a 
thought-moment is never called a <i>citta-vīthi.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>3. Visayappavatti -</b></p>

<p>The commentarial explanation is - &#39;the presentation of objects at the doors,&#39; 
or &#39;the genesis of consciousness on the presentation of such objects.&#39; <i>
(visayānam dvāresu, visayesu ca cittānam pavatti). </i></p>

<p>The author evidently prefers the first explanation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>4. Thought-processes </b></p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma ordinarily there is no moment when we do not 
experience a particular kind of consciousness, hanging on to some object - 
whether physical of mental. The time-limit of such a consciousness is termed one 
thought-moment. The rapidity of the succession of such thought-moments is hardly 
conceivable by the ken of human knowledge. Books state that within the brief 
duration of a flash of lightning, or in the twinkling of an eye billions of 
thought-moments may arise and perish. </p>

<p>Each thought-moment consists of three minor instants <i>(khanas).</i>
They are <i>uppāda</i> (arising or genesis), <i>thiti</i> (static or 
development), and <i>bhanga</i>
(cessation or dissolution). </p>

<p>Birth, decay, and death* correspond to these three states. The interval 
between birth and death is regarded as decay. </p>

<p>Immediately after the cessation stage of a thought-moment there results the 
genesis stage of the subsequent thought-moment. Thus each unit of consciousness 
perishes conditioning another, transmitting at the same time all its 
potentialities to its successor. There is, therefore, a continuous flow of 
consciousness like a stream without any interruption. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[*<font SIZE="2">These three stages correspond to the Hindu view of Brahma 
(Creator). Vishnu (Preserver) and Siva (Destroyer).]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a material object is presented to the mind through one of the five 
sense-doors, a thought-process occurs, consisting of a series of separate 
thought-moments leading one to the other in a particular, uniform order. This 
order is known as the <i>citta-niyāma</i>
(psychic order). As a rule for a complete perception of a physical object 
through one of the sense-doors precisely 17 thought-moments must pass. As such 
the time duration of matter is fixed at 17 thought-moments. After the expiration 
of that time-limit, one fundamental unit of matter perishes giving birth to 
another unit. The first moment is regarded as the genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> the 
last as dissolution <i>(bhanga),</i> and the interval 15 moments as decay or 
development <i>(thiti</i> or<i> jarā). </i></p>

<p>As a rule when an object enters the consciousness through any of the doors 
one moment of the life-continuum elapses. This is known as <i>atīta-bhavanga.</i>
Then the corresponding thought-process runs uninterruptedly for 16 
thought-moments. The object thus presented is regarded as &#39;very great.&#39; </p>

<p>If the thought-process ceases at the expiration of <i>javanas</i>
without giving rise to two retentive moments <i>(tadālambana), </i>thus 
completing only 14 moments, then the object is called &#39;great&#39;. </p>

<p>Sometimes the thought-process ceases at the moment of determining <i>
(votthapana)</i>
without giving rise to the <i>javanas,</i> completing only 7 thought-moments 
Then the object is termed &#39;slight.&#39; </p>

<p>At times when an object enters the consciousness there is merely a vibration 
of the life-continuum. Then the object is termed &#39;very slight.&#39; </p>

<p>When a so-called &#39;very great&#39; or &#39;great&#39; object perceived through the five 
sense-doors, is subsequently conceived by the mind-door, or when a thought 
process arising through the mind-door extends up to the retentive stage, then 
the object is regarded as &#39;clear&#39;.</p>

<p>When a thought process, arising through the mind-door, ceases at the javana 
stage, the object is termed &#39;obscure&#39;. </p>

<p>When, for instance, a person looks at the radiant moon on a cloudless night, 
he gets a faint glimpse of the surrounding stars as well. He focuses his 
attention on the moon, but he cannot avoid the sight of stars around. The moon 
is regarded as a great object, while the stars are regarded as minor objects. 
Both moon and stars are perceived by the mind at different moments. According to 
Abhidhamma it is not correct to say that the stars are perceived by the 
sub-consciousness and the moon by the consciousness. </p>

<p>Herein this is the method of thought-processes with respect to mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>5. Appanā </b>- (Sanskrit - <i>arpanā,</i> derived from <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>ri,</i> to go). </p>

<p>This is a rare Pāli term found in Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>It is derived from the root <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>i,</i> to go </p>

<p>&#39;<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>I</i> + the causal suffix; <i>&#39;āpe&#39; + ana.</i> <i>
&#39;A&#39;</i> is substituted for <i>&#39;i&#39;</i>, and <i>&#39;p&#39;</i> is duplicated; <i>&#39;A&#39; + 
ppe + ana = appanā.</i> The initial <i>&#39;ā&#39;</i> is shortened before double <i>
&#39;p&#39;.</i> </p>

<p>Venerable Buddhaghosa defines <i>&#39;appanā&#39;</i> as the directing or fixing of 
the one-pointed consciousness on an object <i>(ekaggam cittam ārammane appenti). </i></p>

<p>Appanā is a highly developed form of <i>vitakka</i> - initial application of 
the mind, one of the <i>jhāna</i> factors. </p>

<p>The aspirant who wishes to develop <i>jhānas</i> takes for his object a 
suitable subject, according to his temperament. In the course of his 
meditations, as mentioned in the first chapter, he arrives at a stage when he 
would be able to experience the first jhānic ecstasy. </p>

<p>Then a thought-process runs as follows -</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>manodvārāvajjana - parikamma - upacāra - anuloma - gotrabhū - appanā</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is the mind-door consciousness, which precedes the <i>javana</i>
stage, conditioned by objects that enter the avenue of consciousness. </p>

<p>The initial thought-moment of the <i>appanā javana</i>-process is termed <i>
parikamma</i> because it is a preparation for the desired higher consciousness 
whether Sublime <i>(mahaggata)</i> or Supramundane <i>(lokuttara).</i> This is 
followed by another thought-moment known as <i>upacāra</i> because it arises in 
proximity to the higher consciousness. Ordinarily these two thought-moments 
arise at the beginning of the <i>appanā javana</i>-process, but if the person is 
morally advanced only <i>upacāra</i> moment arises without the initial <i>
parikamma</i> moment. </p>

<p>The third thought-moment is known as <i>anuloma</i> because it arises in 
harmony with the preceding thought moments and the following <i>gotrabhū</i> 
thought moment. <i>Gotrabhū,</i> literally, means that which overcomes the 
Sense-sphere lineage or that which develops the sublime or exalted lineage. 
Immediately after this <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment arises the <i>appanā</i> <i>jhāna</i> thought-moment. Absolute 
one-pointedness of the mind is gained at this advanced stage of mental 
development. </p>

<p>The fully undeveloped <i>jhāna,</i> present in the preliminary 
thought-moments, is known as <i>upacāra samādhi,</i> access concentration. </p>

<p>To a worldling and a <i>Sekha</i> one of the four <i>kāmāvacara</i>
moral <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by knowledge, arises as these preliminary <i>
appanā</i>
thought-moments. In the case of an <i>Asekha</i> it is one of the four <i>
kāmāvacara</i>
functional <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by knowledge. </p>

<p><a NAME="page218"></a>The Supramundane <i>appanā javana</i>-process occurs as 
follows -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<i>

<table border="1" width="67%">
  <tr>
    <td width="14%" align="center"></i>1<i></td>
    <td width="14%" align="center"></i>2<i></td>

    <td width="15%">phala</td>
    <td width="15%">phala</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></p>

<p>In this thought-process <i>parikamma</i> may or may not precede. As stated 
above it depends on the moral advancement of the person. Here <i>gotrabhū</i>
means that which overcomes the lineage of the worldling or that which develops 
the supramundane lineage. </p>

<p>One of the four <i>kāmāvacara</i> moral <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by 
knowledge, arises in these preliminary stages. The object of the first three 
thought-moments is mundane but the object of the <i>gotrabhū</i> is supramundane 
Nibbāna. Nevertheless, this developed thought-moment is incapable of eradicating 
the innate defilements. It is the <i>magga</i> (Path) consciousness that 
immediately follows, which performs the double function of intuiting Nibbāna and 
of eradicating the defilements. It should be noted that the Path consciousness 
occurs only once. This is immediately followed by two moments of <i>phala</i> 
(Fruit) consciousness if <i>parikamma</i>
is present. Otherwise there will be three <i>phala</i> thought-moments. </p>

<p>In the case of the second, third, fourth, stages of Sainthood-the fourth 
thought-moment is named <i>vodāna,</i> which means purification, instead of <i>
gotrabhū.</i>
If the <i>parikamma</i> thought-moment precedes, <i>vodāna</i> thought-moment 
arises as the fourth, otherwise as the third. </p>

<p>Each of the four Supramundane Paths arises only once in the course of one&#39;s 
life. But one may experience the Fruit consciousness even for a whole day 
continuously. The three lower fruits, Sotāpatti, Sakadāgāmi, and Anāgāmi are 
preceded by a moral <i>javana.</i> When one enjoys the Fruit of Arahatship the <i>
javanas</i> that immediately precede must be functionals because an Arahat, 
being an <i>Asekha</i> does not experience moral <i>javanas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <i>Tihetuka</i> - conditioned by three <i>hetus - alobha</i>
(generosity), <i>adosa</i> (goodwill) and <i>amoha</i> (wisdom) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. Viz., two types of <i>kāmāvacara</i> consciousness, accompanied by 
pleasure and knowledge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. Namely, the first 4 <i>rūpa jhānas</i> and 28 (7x4) <i>lokuttara jhānas.</i> 
The Arahat Fruit and functionals are excluded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. Namely, 1, 5th <i>rūpa jhāna</i> + 4 <i>arūpa jhānas</i> + 7 <i>lokuttara 
pañcamajjhāna</i>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Procedure of Retention </b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 9. Here, under all circumstances (i.e., in both sense-door and mind-door) 
when an object (12) is undesirable, the five sense-impressions, reception, 
investigation, retention (that arise) are immoral resultants. If desirable, they 
are moral resultants. If the object is extremely desirable, investigation and 
retention are accompanied by pleasure.</p>

<p>In this connection, at the end of functional javanas accompanied by pleasure, 
there arise retentive thought-moments also accompanied by pleasure. At the end 
of functional <i>javanas,</i> accompanied by equanimity, the retentive thought 
moments are also accompanied by equanimity. </p>

<p>But at the end of javanas, accompanied by displeasure, the retentive thought- 
moments and the <i>bhavangas</i> are also accompanied by indifference. Hence to 
one whose rebirth-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure, if, at the end of 
javanas, accompanied by displeasure, retentive thought-moments do not arise, 
then, there arises an investigating consciousness accompanied by indifference, 
hanging on to some sense-object with which one is familiar before. Immediately 
after, the teachers say there is subsidence into the life-continuum.</p>

<p>Likewise they expect retention at the end of Sense-sphere <i>javanas</i>
to the Sense-sphere beings, only when Sense-sphere phenomena become objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 10. Retention occurs, they say, in connection with &#39;clear&#39; and &#39;very great&#39; 
objects when there is certainty as regards the Sense-sphere javanas, beings, and 
objects. </p>

<p>Herein this is the procedure of retention. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>
<b>

<p>12. Objects - ārammana</b></p>

<p>The desirability or undesirability of an object is determined not according 
to individual temperament, but according to its intrinsic nature. The resultant 
consciousness conditioned thereby is regarded as the effect of one&#39;s good or bad 
action. </p>

<p>The sight of the Buddha will perhaps be repulsive to a staunch heretic. His <i>
javana</i> thoughts will naturally be unwholesome. But the passive wholesome 
resultant eye-consciousness, caused by a past good kamma, is a <i>kusala vipāka.</i> 
This
<i>vipāka</i> is not conditioned by his will, but is an inevitable consequence. 
The <i>javana</i>
process, on the contrary, is conditioned by his own will. </p>

<p>Again, for instance, the mere sight of excreta will be a source of delight to 
an ordinary dog. The object is generally undesirable and is a bad effect <i>
(akusala vipāka), </i>but the <i>javana</i> process caused thereby will be 
wholesome to the dog. The accompanying feeling will also be pleasurable. </p>

<p>Although even an Arahat experiences an <i>akusala vipāka</i> at the sight of 
an undesirable object, his <i>javana</i> process will neither be wholesome nor 
unwholesome. The accompanying feeling will be one of equanimity. </p>

<p>Now, when an undesirable object is presented either through the mind-door or 
five sense-doors, the sense-impressions, reception, investigation, retention 
that occur in the respective thought-processes, are all bad effects <i>(akusala 
vipākas).</i>
The accompanying feeling is invariably <i>upekkhā,</i> except in the case of 
body-impression which is <i>dukkha.</i> These thought-moments are the inevitable 
results of past bad actions. </p>

<p>If the presented object is desirable, then the afore-said thought-moments are 
all good effects<i> (kusala vipākas). </i>Here too the accompanying feeling is <i>
upekkhā,</i> except in the case of body-impression which is <i>sukha.</i>
All these thought-moments are the results of past good actions. </p>

<p>When the object is extremely desirable, the feeling of the <i>santīrana</i>
moment differs. Instead of <i>upekkhā</i> it is <i>somanassa. </i></p>

<p>The <i>tadārammanas</i> followed by Sense sphere functional <i>javanas,</i>
accompanied by pleasure, are also associated with a similar feeling. Likewise 
the <i>upekkhā javanas</i> are followed by <i>upekkhā tadārammanas.</i></p>

<p>As a rule the preceding <i>javanas</i> and the subsequent <i>tadārammanas</i>
possess a similar feeling. Somanassa is followed by <i>somanassa,</i> and <i>
upekkhā</i>
by <i>upekkhā.</i> </p>

<p>What happens when the javanas are accompanied by domanassa as there are no <i>
domanassa tadārammanas? </i></p>

<p>If the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta) </i>of the person is 
accompanied by <i>somanassa,</i> then when <i>javanas</i> are accompanied by <i>
domanassa,</i>
the <i>tadārammanas,</i> if they occur, will be accompanied by equanimity <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata),
</i>but if <i>tadārammanas</i> do not occur, then an adventitious <i>upekkhā</i> <i>
santīrana,</i>
without any special function, will intervene for one moment. This adventitious 
thought-moment is technically termed <i>āgantukabhavanga.</i> Usually the object 
of the <i>javanas</i>
and that of the <i>tadārammanas</i> are identical. But in this particular case 
the objects differ. The object of this <i>santīrana</i> is another <i>kāmāvacara</i> 
object with which one is familiar in the course of one&#39;s life. This object is 
termed <i>paritta</i>
(smaller or lesser) in comparison with the higher <i>rūpa, arūpa</i> and <i>
lokuttara</i>
objects. </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the rebirth-consciousness is not associated with
<i>somanassa,</i> then the <i>tadārammanas</i> therein become <i>upekhā</i> as 
are the <i>bhavangas</i>
that follow. </p>

<p>It should be noted that <i>tadārammanas</i> occur only at the end of <i>
kāmāvacara</i>
<i>javanas,</i> only to <i>kāmāvacara</i> beings, and only in connection with <i>
kāmāvacara</i>
objects, which are either &#39;very intense&#39; or &#39;clear.&#39; </p>

<p>Procedure of Javana (13)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 11. Amongst the <i>javanas,</i> in a minor process, the sense-sphere
<i>javanas</i> run only for seven or six times. </p>

<p>But in the case of a feeble process and at the time of dying, etc., only five 
times. </p>

<p>To the Exalted One, at the time of the &#39;Twin Psychic Phenomenon&#39; and the 
like, when the procedure is alert, only four or five reflective thought-moments 
arise, they say. </p>

<p>To the beginner, during the first ecstasy, the Sublime <i>javanas</i>
and super-intellect <i>javanas</i> run only once at all times. Subsequently 
there is subsidence into the life-continuum. </p>

<p>The arising of the four Paths endures for only one thought-moment. Thereafter 
two or three Fruit thought-moments arise accordingly. Then comes subsidence into 
life-continuum . </p>

<p>At the time of Supreme Cessation (14) the fourth <i>arūpa javana</i>
runs twice and then contacts Cessation. When emerging (from this ecstasy) either 
Anāgāmi Fruit-consciousness or Arahatta Fruit-consciousness arises accordingly. 
When it ceases there is subsidence into the life-continuum . </p>

<p>In the process of Attainments there is no regularity of thought-processes, as 
in the stream of the life-continuum. Nevertheless, it should be understood that 
many (Sublime and Supramundane) <i>javanas</i> take place. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 12. It should be known that minor <i>javanas</i> arise seven times, the 
Path and Super-intellect only once, the rest (Sublime and Supramundane) several 
times.
</p>

<p>Herein this is the procedure of <i>javanas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>
<b>

<p>13. Javana -</b></p>

<p>As it is difficult to give an adequate English rendering for <i>javana,</i>
the Pāli term has been retained here. </p>

<p>Both psychologically and ethically <i>javana</i> thought-moments are the most 
important, as both good and evil are determined at this stage. </p>

<p>Sometimes the <i>javanas</i> last only for one moment. At times they may 
continue for seven moments at the most. </p>

<p><i>Kāmāvacara javanas,</i> as a rule, last only for six or seven moments. 
When one is in a senseless state or is about to die, <i>javanas</i> are confined 
to five moments. </p>

<p>When the Buddha, by His psychic powers, emits fire and water, almost 
simultaneously, from His body, only four or five <i>javana</i> thought-moments 
arise so as to reflect on the <i>jhāna</i> factors, which is a prerequisite, for 
the performance of this &#39;Twin Psychic Phenomenon&#39;. </p>

<p>In the case of a yogi who develops the first <i>jhāna</i> for the first time, <i>
javana</i> lasts only for one moment. So is it with those who develop the five <i>
abhiññās</i> - namely, i. Psychic Powers <i>(Iddhividha),</i> ii. Celestial Ear
<i>(Dibba Sota),</i> iii. Celestial Eye <i>(Dibba Cakkhu),</i> iv. Reading of 
Others&#39; Thoughts <i>(Paracittavijānana),</i> and v. Reminiscence of Previous 
Births <i>(Pubbe-nivāsānussati ñāna). </i>The four classes of supramundane <i>
javana</i> Path-consciousness also last for one moment only. It is at this great 
moment that Nibbāna is intuited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>14. Nirodha Samāpatti -</b></p>

<p>An Anāgāmi or an Arahat, who has developed the <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa 
jhānas,</i> could, by will-power, temporarily arrest the ordinary flow of 
consciousness even for seven days continuously. When one attains this state, all 
mental activities cease, although there exist heat and life devoid of any 
breathing. The difference between a corpse and one in this state, is that the 
latter possesses life. Books state too that his body cannot be harmed. The 
attainment of such an ecstatic state is known as <i>nirodha</i>
<i>samāpatti. Nirodha</i> means cessation, and <i>samāpatti</i> is attainment. </p>

<p>Immediately prior to the attainment of this state he experiences for two 
moments the fourth <i>arūpa jhāna</i> (state of neither perception nor 
non-perception). The flow of consciousness then ceases until he emerges 
therefrom as determined by him. As a rule he remains in this state for about a 
week. Motionless he abides in this ecstasy. Books relate an incident of a 
Pacceka Buddha whose body was set fire to while in this state. But he was not 
affected thereby. </p>

<p>Now when he emerges from this state the first thought-moment to arise is an 
Anāgāmi Fruit-consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat 
Fruit-consciousness in the case of an Arahat. Thereafter the stream of 
consciousness subsides into bhavanga.</p>

<p>Classification of Individuals</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 13. Herein, to those whose rebirth-consciousness is conditioned by two 
roots (<font SIZE="2"><i>alobha</i> and <i>adosa)</i></font> and conditioned by 
none, functional javanas and ecstatic javanas (*1) do not arise. Likewise, in a 
happy plane, resultants, accompanied by knowledge, also do not arise (*2). But 
in a woeful state they do not also get great resultants dissociated with 
knowledge </p>

<p>To the Corruption-freed (Arahats) amongst those whose rebirth-consciousness 
is conditioned by three roots, no moral nor immoral <i>javanas</i>
arise. Similarly to the Sekhas and worldlings functional <i>javanas</i> do not 
arise. Nor do the <i>javanas</i> connected with misbelief and doubts arise to 
the Sekhas.(*3) To the Anāgāmi individuals there are no <i>javanas</i> connected 
with aversion. (*4) But the supramundane <i>javanas</i> are experienced only by 
Ariyas (*5) according to their respective capacities. </p>

<p>§ 14. As they arise it is stated that Asekhas experience 44 (*6), Sekhas 56

<p>Immediately after this five sense-door thought-process, the stream of

<h2>Summary of Rebirth Procedure</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§1. Thus, according to thought-processes, the life&#39;s course (extending from 
birth to decease) has been explained. Now the summary of the procedure at 
rebirth will be told. </p>

<p>§2. In the summary of process-freed consciousness, four sets of four should 
be understood as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) four planes of life (1); </li>
  <li>(ii) four modes of rebirth; </li>
  <li>(iii) four kinds of actions; </li>
  <li>(iv) fourfold advent of death. </li>
</ul>

<h3>i. Four Planes of Life</h3>

<p>Of these, the four planes of life are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Unhappy plane (2); </li>
  <li>2. Sensuous blissful plane (3); </li>
  <li>3. Rūpavācara plane (4); </li>
  <li>4. Arūpavācara plane (5). </li>
</ul>

<p>Among these the Unhappy plane is fourfold - namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) Woeful State (6), </li>
  <li>(ii) Animal Kingdom (7), </li>
  <li>(iii) Peta Sphere (8), </li>
  <li>(iv) the Host of Asuras (9). </li>
</ul>

<p>The Sensuous blissful plane is sevenfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) Human Realm ( 10),
  </li>
  <li>(ii) the Realm of the Four Kings (11), </li>
  <li>(iii) the Realm of the Thirty-three gods (12), </li>
  <li>(iv) the Realm of the Yāma gods (13), </li>
  <li>(v) the Delightful Realm (14), </li>
  <li>(vi) the Realm of the gods who rejoice in (their own) creations (15),&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li>(vii) the Realm of the gods who lord over the creations of others (16). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These eleven kinds of sphere constitute the Kāmāvacara plane. </p>

<p>The Rūpavācara plane is sixteen fold - namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) the first jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>1. the Realm of Brahma&#39;s Retinue, </li>
    <li>2. the Realm of Brahma&#39;s Ministers,</li>
    <li>3. the Mahā Brahmā Realm (17); </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(ii) the second jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>4. the Realm of Minor Lustre, </li>
    <li>5. the Realm of Infinite Lustre, and </li>
    <li>6. the Realm of Radiant Lustre; </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(iii) the third jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>7. the Realm of Minor Aura, </li>
    <li>8. the Realm of Infinite Aura, and </li>
    <li>9. the Realm of Steady Aura; </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(iv) the fourth jhāna plane, to wit, 
  <ul>
    <li>10. the Realm of Great Reward, </li>
    <li>11. the Realm of Mindless Beings (18), and </li>
    <li>12. the Pure Abodes (19). </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Pure Abodes are fivefold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. the Durable Realm, </li>
  <li>ii. the Serene Realm, </li>
  <li>iii. the Beautiful Realm, </li>
  <li>iv. the Clear-sighted Realm, and </li>
  <li>v. the Highest Realm. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Arūpāvacara plane (20) is fourfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) the Realm of Infinite Space, </li>
  <li>(ii) the Realm of Infinite Consciousness. </li>
  <li>(iii) the Realm of Nothingness, </li>
  <li>(iv) the Realm of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. In the Pure Abodes no worldlings, Stream-Winners (<font SIZE="2">See p. </font><a HREF="#page68">
*</a><font SIZE="2">.)</font>, or Once-Returners are born in any way. </p>

<p>The Ariyas (those who have attained the four stages of Sainthood, all 
worldings are called Non-Ariyas) are not born in mindless Realms and Woeful 
States. In other planes are born both Ariyas and Non-Ariyas. </p>

<p>Herein these are the fourfold planes. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p><b>1. Bhūmi. </b>derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>bhu,</i>
to be, lit., means a place where beings exist. </p>

<p>According to Buddhism the earth, an almost insignificant speck in the 
universe, is not the only habitable world, and humans are not the only living 
beings, Infinite are world systems and so are living beings. Nor is &quot;the 
impregnated ovum the only route to rebirth&quot; &quot;By traversing one cannot reach the 
end of the world,&quot; says the Buddha.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>* <font SIZE="2">&quot;There are about 1,000,000 planetary systems in the Milky 
Way in which life exists.&quot; See Fred Hoyle, The Nature of the Universe, pp. 
87-89.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>2. Apāya</b> = <i>apa + aya.</i> That which is devoid of happiness is 
apāya. It is viewed both as a mental state and as a place. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. States where sense-pleasures abound. See p. <a HREF="#page10">*</a>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. and 5. See p. <a HREF="#page11">*</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Niraya</b> = <i>ni + aya;</i> devoid of happiness. According to 
Buddhism there are several woeful states where beings atone for their evil 
kamma. They are not eternal hells where beings are subject to endless suffering. 
Upon the exhaustion of the evil Kamma there is a possibility for beings born in 
such states to be reborn in good states as the result of their past good 
actions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Tiracchāna</b> = <i>tiro,</i> across; <i>acchāna,</i> going. Animals 
are so called because as a rule quadrupeds walk horizontally. Buddhist belief is 
that beings are born as animals on account of evil Kamma. There is, however, the 
possibility for animals to be born as human beings. Strictly speaking, it should 
be said that an animal may manifest itself in the form of a human being, or <i>
vice versa,</i>
just as an electric current can be manifested in the forms of light, heat, and 
motion successively - one not necessarily being evolved from the other. An 
animal may be born in a blissful state as a result of the good Kamma accumulated 
in the past. There are at times certain animals, particularly dogs and cats, who 
live a more comfortable life than even human beings. It is also due to their 
past good Kamma. </p>

<p>It is one&#39;s Kamma that determines the nature of one&#39;s material form, which 
varies according to the skill or unskilfulness of one&#39;s actions. And this again 
depends entirely on the evolution of one&#39;s understanding of reality. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Peta</b> = <i>pa + ita;</i> lit., departed beings, or (those) 
absolutely devoid of happiness. They are not disembodied spirits or ghosts. 
Although they possess material forms, generally they are invisible to the 
physical eye. They have no plane of their own, but live in forests, dirty 
surroundings, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Asura</b> - lit., those who do not sport or those who do not shine. 
These Asuras should be distinguished from another class of Asuras who are 
opposed to Devas, and who live in the Tāvatimsa plane (see note 12). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Manussa</b> - lit., those who have an uplifted or developed mind
<i>(mano ussannam etesam). </i>Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>Manushya,</i> which 
means the sons of <i>Manu.</i> They are so called because they became civilized 
after <i>Manu</i>
the seer. </p>

<p>The human realm is a mixture of both pain and happiness. Bodhisattas prefer 
the human realm, as they get a better opportunity to serve the world and perfect 
the requisites for Buddha hood. Buddhas are always born as human beings. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Cātummahārājika</b> - This is the lowest of the heavenly realms where 
the four Guardian Deities reside with their followers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Tāvatimsa</b> - lit., thirty-three. Sakka, the king of the gods, 
resides in this celestial plane. The origin of the name is attributed to a story 
which states that thirty-three selfless volunteers led by Magha, having 
performed charitable deeds, were born in this heavenly realm. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Yāma </b>- derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>yam,</i>
to destroy. That which destroys pain is <i>yāma.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Tusita</b> - lit., happy-dwellers. Traditional belief is that the 
future Bodhisatta dwells at present in this celestial plane, awaiting the right 
opportunity to be born as a human being and become a Buddha. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Nimmānarati</b> - Those who delight in the created mansions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Paranimmitavasavatti</b> - lit., those who bring under their sway 
things created by others. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the six Celestial planes - all temporary blissful abodes - where 
beings are supposed to live happily enjoying fleeting pleasures of sense. 
Superior to these Sensuous planes are the Brahma realms where beings delight in 
jhānic bliss, achieved by renouncing sense-desires. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. These are the three Brahma realms where beings who have developed the 
first jhāna are born. The lowest of these three is Brahma Pārisajja, which, 
literally, means &quot;Those who are born amongst the attendants of Mahā-Brahmas.&quot; 
The second is Brahma Purohita which means Brahma&#39;s Ministers. The highest of the 
first three is Mahā Brahmā. It is so called because these beings exceed others 
in happiness, beauty and age-limit, owing to the intrinsic merit of their mental 
development. </p>

<p>Those who develop the first jhāna to a normal extent are born in the first 
plane; those who have developed to a medium degree are born in the second; and 
those who have perfect control of the first jhāna are born amongst the Mahā 
Brahmas in the third plane. The three divisions of the other jhānic planes 
should be similarly understood. </p>

<p>18. <b>Asasññasatta</b> - This is supposed to be a plane where beings are 
born without a consciousness. Here only a material flux exists, normally both 
mind and matter are inseparable. By the power of meditation it is possible, at 
times, to separate matter from mind as in this particular case. When Arahat 
attains the <i>Nirodha</i> <i>Samāpatti,</i>
his consciousness ceases to exist temporarily. Such a state is almost 
inconceivable to us. But there may be many inconceivable things which are actual 
facts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. Suddhāvāsa - Only Anāgāmis and Arahats are found in these planes. Those 
who attain Anāgāmi in other planes are born in these Pure Abodes. Later, they 
attain Arahatship and live in those planes till their life-term is over. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. See p. <a HREF="#page11">*</a>. All these four are immaterial planes. </p>

<p>It should be remarked that the Buddha did not attempt to expound any 
cosmological theory. </p>

<p>The essence of the Buddha&#39;s teaching is not affected by the existence or 
non-existence of these planes. No one is bound to believe anything if it does 
not appeal to his reason. Nor is it right to reject anything just because it 
cannot be conceived by one&#39;s limited knowledge. </p>

<h3>ii. Fourfold Rebirth</h3>

<p>§ 4. Rebirth is fourfold-namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) rebirth in a Woeful State, </li>
  <li>(ii) rebirth in a blissful Sense-sphere, </li>
  <li>(iii) rebirth in a <i>Rūpāvacara</i> plane, and </li>
  <li>(iv) rebirth in an <i>Arūpāvacara</i> plane. </li>
</ul>

<p>Therein the immoral resultant investigating consciousness, accompanied by 
indifference, (21) becomes the re-linking (consciousness) at the moment of 
descent into a woeful state. Then it lapses into <i>bhavanga</i> and finally it 
becomes the decease (consciousness) and is cut off. </p>

<p>This is the one single woeful rebirth. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moral resultant investigating consciousness, accompanied by indifference, 
persists as the re-linking, life-continuum and decease (consciousness) of 
degraded human beings of the blissful Sense-sphere, such as those born blind and 
so forth (22), and also of earth-bound fallen (23) Asuras. </p>

<p>The eight great resultants (24) act as the re-linking, life-continuum, and 
decease (consciousness) everywhere in the blissful Sense-sphere. </p>

<p>These nine comprise rebirth in the blissful Sense sphere. </p>

<p>The (foregoing) ten modes are reckoned as rebirth in the <i>Kāmāvacara</i>
plane. </p>

<p>There is no definite limit to the duration of life of beings born in Woeful 
States amongst humans and fallen Asuras (25). </p>

<p>The age-limit of gods of the Realm of Four Kings is 500 celestial years (26), 
that is, according to human reckoning, 9,000,000.</p>

<p>The age-limit of the Thirty-three gods is four times this amount. The 
age-limit of Delightful gods is four times that of the Thirty-three. Four times 
that amount is the age-limit of the gods who delight in their creations. Four 
times that amount is the age-limit of those who lord over the creations of 
others. </p>

<p>In the plane of those who lord over others&#39; creations the age-limit, 
according to human reckoning, is nine hundred and twenty million sixty thousand 
years. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 5. The first <i>jhāna</i> resultant occurs in the first <i>jhāna</i>
plane as the re-linking, life-continuum, and decease (consciousness); similarly 
the second <i>jhāna</i>
resultant and the third <i>jhāna</i> resultant in the second <i>jhāna</i> plane; 
the fourth <i>jhāna</i> resultant in the third <i>jhāna</i> plane; the fifth <i>
jhāna</i>
resultant in the fourth-<i>jhāna</i> plane. But for mindless beings material 
form itself occurs as rebirth. Similarly thereafter, during lifetime and at the 
moment of decease, only material form exists and perishes. </p>

<p>These six are the modes of rebirth on the <i>Rūpāvacara</i> plane. </p>

<p>Among these the age-limit of the gods of Brahma&#39;s Retinue is one-third of an 
aeon (27); of Brahma&#39;s Ministers is half an aeon; of Mahā Brahma is one aeon; of 
Minor Lustre two aeons (28); of Infinite Lustre four aeons; of Radiant gods 
eight aeons; of Minor Aura 16 aeons; of Infinite Aura 32 aeons; of Steady Aura 
64 aeons; of Great Reward and Mindless Beings 500 aeons; of Durable gods 1,000 
aeons; of Serene gods 2,000 aeons; Beautiful gods 4,000 aeons; of Clear-sighted 
gods 8,000 aeons; of The Highest gods 16,000 aeons. </p>

<p>The first <i>arūpa jhāna</i> resultant and others occur respectively on the 
first and other <i>arūpa</i> planes as the re-linking life-continuum and decease 
(consciousness).</p>

<p>These are the four modes of rebirth on the <i>arūpa</i>-plane. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among them the age-limit of gods who have attained to the Realm of Infinity 
of Space is 20,000 aeons; of those who have attained to the Realm of Infinity of 
Consciousness is 40,000 aeons; of those who have attained to the Realm of 
Nothingness is 60,000 aeons; of those who have attained to the Realm of neither 
Perception nor non-Perception is 84,000 aeons. (<font SIZE="2">See diagram X.)</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 6. The re-linking consciousness, life-continuum consciousness, and the 
decease consciousness in one (particular) birth are similar (here <i>eka</i>
does not mean one) and have an identical object. </p>

<p>Herein this is the Fourfold Rebirth. </p>

<a name='8-4' href='?#8-4'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>21. <b>Akusala-Vipāka.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. Though congenitally blind, deaf or dumb they are born as human beings 
because of their past good Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. i.e., fallen from happiness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. These are the eight <i>sobhana vipāka cittas.</i> See Chapter I, p. <a HREF="#page38">
*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. Beings suffer in Woeful states in accordance with their Kamma. Their 
age-limit differs according to the gravity of the evil deed. Some are 
short-lived, and some are long-lived. Mallikā, the queen of King Pasenadi of 
Kosala, for in stance, had to suffer in a woeful state for only seven days. 
Devadatta, on the other hand, is destined to suffer for an aeon. </p>

<p>At times, earth, bound deities live for only seven days. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. Books state that 50 human years equal one celestial day. Thirty such days 
amount to one month, and twelve such months constitute one year. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Kappa</b> - That which is thought of in accordance with the analogy of 
mustard seeds and the rock <i>(kappīyati sāsapapabbatopamāhi&#39; ti kappo). </i></p>

<p>There are three kinds of <i>kappas,</i> namely, <i>antara kappa, asankheyya 
kappa,</i> and <i>mahā kappa.</i> The interim period when the age-limit of human 
beings rises from ten to an indefinite time and then falls to ten again, is 
known as an <i>antara kappa.</i> Twenty such <i>antara kappas</i> equal one <i>
asankheyya</i> <i>kappa</i>
- literally an incalculable cycle. Four <i>asankheyya</i> <i>kappas</i> equal 
one <i>mahā kappa.</i> This exceeds the time required to exhaust a volume, a <i>
yojana</i> in length breadth, and height, filled with mustard seeds, by throwing 
away a seed once in every hundred years. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. By kappa, here and in the following cases, is meant a <i>mahā kappa. </i></p>

        <li>(b) Subsequently Effective Kamma, (c) </li>

        <li>(d) Moral Kamma pertaining to the Arūpa plane. </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Of them Immoral Kamma is threefold according to the doors of action, namely, 
bodily action, verbal action, and mental action. </p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, are bodily actions done generally 
(39) through the door of the body, known as bodily intimation (40). </p>

<p>Lying, slandering, harsh speech, and vain talk, are verbal actions done 
generally through the door of speech, known as verbal intimation (41). </p>

<p>Covetousness, ill will, and false belief (42), are mental actions done 
generally through the mind itself without (bodily or verbal) intimation. </p>

<p>Of them killing, harsh speech, and ill will, spring from the root of hatred; 
sexual misconduct, covetousness, and false belief (42), from the root of 
attachment; the remaining four arise from the two roots. </p>

<p>According to the classes of consciousness Immoral Kamma is twelve fold.
</p>

<p>Moral Kamma of the <i>Kāma</i>-plane is threefold according to the doors of 
action, namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>deeds pertaining to the door of the body, </li>
  <li>verbal actions pertaining to the door of speech, </li>
  <li>mental actions pertaining to the door of the mind. </li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly it is threefold as generosity, morality, and meditation. It is 
eight fold according to the classes of consciousness. </p>

<p>It is also tenfold according to </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) generosity, </li>
  <li>(ii) morality, </li>
  <li>(iii) meditation, </li>
  <li>(iv) reverence, </li>
  <li>(v) service, </li>
  <li>(vi) transference of merit, </li>
  <li>(vii) rejoicing in (others) merit, </li>
  <li>(viii) hearing the doctrine, </li>
  <li>(ix) teaching the doctrine, </li>
  <li>(x) and straightening one&#39;s views (43). </li>
</ul>

<p>* Of these ten, (vi) and (vii) are included in generosity (<i>dāna</i>), (iv) 
and (v) in morality (<i>sīla</i>), (viii), (ix) and (x) in meditation (<i>bhavana</i>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All these twenty kinds (immoral and moral) are regarded as Kamma pertaining 
to the <i>kāma</i>-plane. </p>

<p>Moral Kamma of the <i>Rūpa</i>-plane is purely mental action, and is caused 
by meditation. According to the <i>jhāna</i> factors that involve ecstasy it is 
fivefold. </p>

<p>Similarly moral Kamma of the Arūpa plane is mental action, and is also caused 
by meditation. According to the objects of <i>jhāna</i> that involve ecstasy it 
is fourfold. (See Ch. I.) </p>

<p>Herein immoral Kamma, excluding restlessness (<i>uddhacca</i>
is too weak to produce rebirth.), causes rebirth in a Woeful State. But during 
lifetime all the twelve take effect (44), as the seven unwholesome resultants 
are experienced anywhere in the <i>kāma</i> plane or the <i>rūpa</i> plane 
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>Moral Kamma (45) of the <i>kāma</i>-plane produces rebirth in the blissful <i>
kāma</i>-plane. Similarly the eight Great Resultants (are experienced in the 
blissful <i>kāma</i>-plane) during lifetime. The eight (wholesome) rootless 
resultants are experienced anywhere in the <i>kāma</i>-plane or <i>rūpa</i>-plane 
according to circumstances. </p>

<p>Therein the highest moral Kamma (46), accompanied by three roots, produces 
rebirth similarly accompanied by the three roots. During lifetime it gives 
effect to sixteen kinds of resultants (the eight Beautiful and eight Rootless 
resultants).</p>

<p>Moral Kamma, accompanied by three roots of a lower class (47), and by two 
roots of a higher class, produces rebirth with two roots, and gives effect to 
twelve resultants, excluding those with three roots, during lifetime. </p>

<p>But moral Kamma, accompanied by two roots of a lower class, produces rebirth 
without roots, and gives effect to rootless resultants during lifetime. </p>

<p>Unprompted moral consciousness does not produce a prompted resultant. Some 
say that a prompted moral consciousness does not produce and unprompted 
resultant. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 8. Some (teachers) (48) say that unprompted thoughts do not produce 
prompted resultants and prompted thoughts do not produce unprompted resultants. </p>

<p>According to them, as stated above, the arising of the resultants, in due 
order, twelve, ten and eight (49), should be set forth. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 9. As regards moral Kamma of the <i>rūpa</i>-plane those who develop the 
first jhāna to a minor degree are born amongst Brahma&#39;s Retinue. Developing the 
same to a medium degree, they are born amongst Brahma&#39;s Ministers. Developing 
them to a high degree they are born amongst the Mahā Brahma gods. </p>

<p>Similarly, developing the second <i>jhāna</i> and the third <i>jhāna</i>
to a minor degree, they are born amongst the gods of Minor Lustre. Developing 
them to a medium degree, they are born amongst gods of Infinite Lustre. 
Developing them to a high degree, they are born amongst the Radiant gods. </p>

<p>Developing the fourth <i>jhāna</i> to a minor degree, they are born amongst 
the gods of Minor Aura. Developing it to a medium degree, they are born amongst 
gods full of Unlimited Aura. Developing it to a high degree, they are born 
amongst gods of Steady Aura. </p>

<p>Developing the fifth jhāna they are born amongst the gods of the Great 
Reward. </p>

<p>Developing it with no attachment to consciousness, they are born amongst 
beings without consciousness. </p>

<p>The Never-Returners are born in the Pure Abodes (50). </p>

<p>Developing moral Kamma pertaining to the Formless sphere, they are born in 
Formless Spheres in corresponding order. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 10. Thus sublimated merit, determined according to sphere, produces similar 
results (both) at rebirth and in one&#39;s lifetime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Herein this is the fourfold Kamma. </p>

<a name='8-7' href='?#8-7'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>29. <b>Kamma,</b> Sanskrit Karma, lit. means action, of doing. Strictly 
speaking, Kamma means all moral and immoral volition (cetanā). It covers all 
that is included in the phrase - &quot;thought, word and deed&quot;. It is the law of 
moral causation. In other words, it is action and reaction in the ethical realm, 
or &quot;action influence&quot; as Westerners say. It is not fate or predestination. It is 
one&#39;s own doing reacting on oneself. </p>

<p>Every volitional action, except that of a Buddha or of an Arahat, is called 
Kamma. The Buddhas and Arahats do not accumulate fresh Kamma as they have 
eradicated ignorance and craving, the roots of Kamma. </p>

<p>Kamma is action, and Vipāka, fruit or result, is its reaction. It is the 
cause and the effect. Like a seed is Kamma. Vipāka (effect) is like the fruit 
arising from the tree. As we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime in this life or 
in a future birth. What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present 
or in the past. </p>

<p>Kamma is a law in itself, and it operates in its own field without the 
intervention of an external independent ruling agency. </p>

<p>Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its due effect. The cause 
produces the effect; the effect explains the cause. The seed produces the fruit; 
the fruit explains the seed; such is their relationship. Even so are Kamma and 
its effect: &quot;the effect already blooms in the cause&quot;. </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma, Kamma constitutes the twelve types of immoral 
consciousness, eight types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere <i>
(kāmāvacara),</i>
five types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Forms <i>
(rūpāvacara), </i>and four types of moral consciousness pertaining to the 
Formless Realms <i>(arūpāvacara). </i></p>

<p>The eight types of supramundane consciousness <i>(lokuttara citta)</i>
are not regarded as Kamma and <i>vipāka,</i> because they tend to eradicate the 
roots of Kamma that condition rebirth. In the supramundane consciousness wisdom <i>
(paññā)</i>
is predominant, while in the ordinary types of consciousness volition <i>
(cetanā)</i> is predominant. </p>

<p>These twenty-nine types of consciousness are called Kamma because the 
reproductive power is inherent in them. Just as every object is accompanied by a 
shadow, even so every volitional activity is accompanied by its due effect. </p>

<p>These types of consciousness that are experienced as inevitable consequences 
of good and bad thoughts, are called resultant consciousness <i>(vipāka).</i>
The 23 types (7+8+8) of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere, 
the five types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Form, and 
the four types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Formless Realms, are 
called <i>vipāka</i> or fruition of Kamma. </p>

<p>(See The Life of the Buddha and his Teachings, pp. 333-391, and Manual of 
Buddhism, pp. 19-88)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. Every birth is conditioned by a past good or bad Kamma which predominates 
at the moment of death. The Kamma that conditions the future birth is called 
Reproductive (Janaka) Kamma. </p>

<p>The death of a person is merely &quot;the temporary end of a temporary 
phenomenon&quot;. Though the present form perishes, another form which is neither the 
same nor absolutely different, takes its place according to the potential 
thought-vibrations generated at the death moment, as the Kammic force which 
propels the life-flux still survives. It is this last thought, which is 
technically called Reproductive Kamma, that determines the state of a person in 
his subsequent birth. This may be either a good or bad Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the commentary, Janaka Kamma is that which produces mental 
aggregates and material aggregates at the moment of conception. The initial 
consciousness, which is termed the <i>patisandhi viññāna</i> 
(rebirth-consciousness), is conditioned by this Janaka Kamma. Simultaneous with 
the arising of the rebirth-consciousness there arise the body-decade, 
sex-decade, and base-decade <i>(kāya-bhāva-vatthu dasaka). </i></p>

<p>The body-decade is composed of the four elements - namely,  </p>

<ul>
  <li>the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> </li>
  <li>the element of cohesion <i>(āpo), </i></li>
  <li>the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> </li>
  <li>the element of motion <i>(vāyo);</i> </li>
</ul>

<p>their four derivatives <i>(upādārūpa) </i>- namely,  </p>

<ul>
  <li>colour <i>(vanna),</i> </li>
  <li>odour <i>(gandha),</i> </li>
  <li>taste <i>(rasa),</i> </li>
  <li>nutritive essence <i>(ojā);</i> </li>
</ul>

<p>vitality <i>(jīvitindriya),</i> and body <i>(kāya). </i>The sex-decade and 
the base-decade also consist of the first nine plus sex <i>(bhāva)</i> and seat 
of consciousness <i>(vatthu) </i>respectively.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that the sex is determined at the very conception of 
a being. I t is conditioned by Kamma and is not a fortuitous combination of 
sperm and ovum cells. Pain and happiness, which one experiences in the course of 
one&#39;s lifetime, are the inevitable consequences of Janaka Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Upatthambhaka</b> - that which comes near the Reproductive Kamma and 
supports it. It is either good or bad, and it assists or maintains the action of 
the Reproductive Kamma in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. Immediately after the 
conception till the death moment, this Kamma steps forward to support the 
Reproductive Kamma. A moral Supportive Kamma assists in giving health, wealth, 
happiness, etc., to the person concerned. An immoral Supportive Kamma, on the 
other hand, assists in giving pain, sorrow, etc., to the person born with an 
immoral Reproductive Kamma as, for instance, to a beast of burden. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Upapīdaka</b> - Obstructive or Counteractive Kamma which, unlike the 
previous one, tends to weaken, interrupt and retard the fruition of the 
Reproductive Kamma. For instance, a person born with a good Reproductive Kamma 
maybe subject to various ailments, etc., thus preventing him from enjoying the 
blissful results of his good action. An animal, on the other hand, who is born 
with a bad Reproductive Kamma, may lead a comfortable life by getting good food, 
lodging, etc., as a result of his good Counteractive Kamma preventing the 
fruition of the evil Reproductive Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Upaghātaka</b> - According to the Law of Kamma the potential energy of 
the Reproductive Kamma could be nullified by a more powerful opposing Kamma of 
the past, which, seeking an opportunity, may quite unexpectedly operate, just as 
a counteractive powerful force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow and bring 
it down to the ground. Such an action is called Destructive Kamma, which is more 
effective than the previous two in that it not only obstructs but also destroys 
the whole force. This Destructive Kamma also may be either good or bad. </p>

<p>As an instance of the operation of all four, the case of Devadatta, who 
attempted to kill the Buddha and who caused a schism in the Sangha, may be 
cited. His good Reproductive Kamma conditioned him a birth in a royal family. 
His continued comforts and prosperity were due to the action of the Supportive 
Kamma. The counteractive Kamma came into operation when he was subject to much 
humiliation as a result of his being excommunicated from the Sangha. Finally the 
Destructive Kamma brought his life to a miserable end. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Garuka</b> - which means either weighty or serious, may be either good 
or bad. It produces its results in this life, or in the next for certain. If 
good, it is purely mental as in the case of the <i>jhānas.</i> Otherwise it is 
verbal or bodily. The five kinds of immoral Weighty Kamma according to their 
gravity are: - (i) the creation of a schism in the Sangha, (ii) the wounding of 
a Buddha, (iii) the murder of an Arahat, (iv) matricide, and (v) parricide. </p>

<p>These are also known as ānantariya Kamma because they definitely produce 
their effects in the subsequent life. Permanent Skepticism <i>(niyata 
micchāditthi)</i> is also termed one of the Weighty Kammas. </p>

<p>If, for instance, any person were to develop the <i>jhānas</i> and later were 
to commit one of these heinous crimes, his good Kamma would be obliterated by 
the powerful evil Kamma. His subsequent birth would be conditioned by the evil 
Kamma in spite of his having gained the <i>jhānas</i> earlier. Devadatta lost 
his psychic powers and was born in an evil state, because he wounded the Buddha 
and caused a schism in the Sangha. </p>

<p>King Ajātasattu would have attained the first stage of sainthood if he had 
not committed parricide. In this case the powerful evil Kamma acted as an 
obstacle to his gaining sainthood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. <b>āsanna,</b> or Death-proximate Kamma, is that which one does or 
remembers immediately before the dying moment. Owing to its significance in 
determining the future birth, the custom of reminding the dying person of his 
good deeds and making him do good acts on his death-bed still prevails in 
Buddhist countries. </p>

<p>Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receive a good birth if 
fortunately he remembers or does a good act at the last moment. A story runs 
that a certain executioner, who casually happened to give some alms to the 
Venerable Sāriputta, remembered this good act at the dying moment and was born 
in a state of bliss. This does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth he 
will be exempt from the effects of the evil deeds accumulated during his 
lifetime. They will have their due effects as occasions arise. </p>

<p>At times a good person may die unhappily by suddenly remembering an evil act 
of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought, perchance compelled by 
unfavourable circumstances. Queen Mallikā, the consort of King Pasenadi, led a 
righteous life, but as a result of remembering, at her death moment, a lie which 
she had uttered, she had to suffer for about seven days in a state of misery. </p>

<p>These are only exceptional cases. Such reverse changes of birth account for 
the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and of vicious children to 
virtuous parents. As a rule the last thought-process is conditioned by the 
general conduct of a person. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>ācinna Kamma</b> is that which one habitually performs and recollects 
and for which one has a great liking. </p>

<p>Habits, whether good or bad, become second nature. They tend to form the 
character of a person. At leisure moments we often engage ourselves in our 
habitual thoughts and deeds. In the same way at the death-moment, unless 
influenced by other circumstances, we, as a rule, recall to mind such thoughts 
and deeds. </p>

<p>Cunda, a butcher, who was living in the vicinity of the Buddha&#39;s Monastery, 
died squealing like a pig because he was earning his living by slaughtering 
pigs. </p>

<p>King Dutthagāmani of Ceylon was in the habit of giving alms to the Bhikkhus 
before he took his meals. It was this habitual Kamma that gladdened him at the 
dying moment and gave him birth in the Tusita Realm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Katattā</b> - Reserve or Cumulative Kamma. Literally, it means 
&quot;because done&quot;. All actions that are done once and soon forgotten belong to this 
category. This is as it were the reserve fund of a particular being. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Ditthadhammavedanāya Kamma</b> is that which is experienced in this 
particular life. <i>Ditthadhamma</i> means this present life. </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma one does both good and evil during the <i>javana</i>
process which usually lasts for seven thought-moments. The effect of the first 
thought-moment, being the weakest, one may reap in this life itself. This is 
called the Immediately Effective Kamma. If it does not operate in this life, it 
is called Defunct or Ineffective <i>(ahosi).</i> The next weakest is the seventh 
thought-moment. Its evil effect one may reap in the subsequent birth. This is 
called <i>Upapajjavedanīya Kamma.</i>
This, too, becomes ineffective if it does not operate in the second birth. The 
effects of the intermediate thought-moments may take place at any time until one 
attains Nibbāna. This type of Kamma is known as Aparāpariyavedanīya - 
Indefinitely Effective. No one, not even the Buddhas and Arahats, is exempt from 
this class of Kamma, which one may experience in the course of one&#39;s wanderings 
in Samsāra. There is no special class of Kamma known as
<i>ahosi,</i> but when such actions that should produce their effects in the 
present life or in a subsequent life do not operate, they are termed 
Ineffective. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Bāhullavuttito</b> - This term is used because these actions may be 
done through the other doors as well. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Kāyaviññatti</b> - expressing the intention through bodily movements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Vacīviññatti</b> - expressing the intention through speech. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. By false beliefs are meant the following three misconceptions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. Everything has sprung without a cause <i>(ahetuka ditthi).</i> </li>
  <li>ii. Good and bad produce no effect <i>(akiriya ditthi)</i> and </li>
  <li>iii. There is no after-life <i>(natthika ditthi).</i></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. i.e., by viewing rightly, such as, &quot;it is beneficial to give alms,&quot; etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. The evil effects of the twelve types of immoral consciousness are the 
seven types of rootless resultant consciousness. They may take effect in the 
course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. The desirable effects of moral actions are the eight types of Rootless 
resultant consciousness and the eight types of Beautiful resultant 
consciousness. The effects of the eight types of moral consciousness may not 
only serve as rebirth consciousness but also give rise to different types of 
resultant consciousness in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. <b>Ukkattha</b> - lit., up <i>(u)</i> drawn <i>(<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
kas). </i>A highest class of moral Kamma is that which is attended with good 
causes before and after the commission of the act. For instance, alms given to 
the most virtuous with righteously obtained wealth, with no later repentance, is 
considered a &#39;highest&#39; moral Kamma.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. <b>Omaka</b> - Inferior. While giving alms one may experience a moral 
consciousness with the three good roots. But, if he were to give to the vicious 
with unrighteously obtained wealth, and with later repentance, it is regarded as 
an inferior Kamma. </p>

  Unprompted Resultants. </li>
  <li>Ten - 8 <i>ahetuka vipākas</i> and 2 prompted or 2 unprompted resultants 
  unaccompanied by wisdom. </li>
  <li>Eight - 8 <i>ahetukas. </i></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>50. The Sotāpannas and Sakadāgāmis, who develop the fifth <i>jhāna,</i>
are born in the <i>Vehapphala</i> plane. But those Sotāpannas and Sakadāgāmis, 
who develop a dispassion for material existence, are born in formless realms. </p>

<p>The Anāgāmis, who have developed the fifth <i>jhāna</i> and who possess the 
five faculties such as confidence, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and 
wisdom to an equal degree, are born in the <i>Vehapphala</i> plane. Those who 
surpass in confidence <i>(saddhā)</i> are born in the <i>Aviha</i> plane; those 
who surpass in energy <i>(viriya)</i> in the <i>Atappa</i> plane; those who 
surpass in mindfulness <i>(sati)</i>
in the <i>Sudassa</i> plane; those who surpass in concentration <i>(samādhi)</i> 
in the <i>Suddassi</i>
plane; and those who surpass in wisdom (paññā) in the <i>Akanittha</i> plane. </p>

<p>There is no fixed rule that Anāgāmis are not born in other suitable planes. </p>

<p><i>(Te pana aññattha na nibbattantīti niyamo natthi.</i> - Comm.) </p>

<p>&quot;Dry-visioned&quot; <i>(sukkha-vipassaka)</i> Anāgāmis, who have followed the 
contemplation course, develop <i>jhānas</i> before death and are consequently 
born in the Pure Abodes. </p>

<p>iv . Procedure with Regard to Decease and Rebirth </b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 11. The advent of death (51) is fourfold, namely, </p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) through the expiration of the age-limit (52), </li>
  <li>(ii) through the expiration of the (Reproductive) Kammic force (53) </li>
  <li>(iii) through the (simultaneous) expiration of both (54), and </li>
  <li>(iv) through (the intervention of a) Destructive Kamma (55). </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, to those who are about to die, at the moment of death, by the power of 
Kamma, one of the following presents itself through any of the six doors: </p>

<ul>
  <li>i. a Kamma that produces rebirth in the subsequent birth enters (the 
  mind-door) according to circumstances (56); </li>
  <li>ii. an object (51) such as a pre-perceived form and the like, or anything 
  that was instrumental in the performance of the Kamma. </li>
  <li>iii. a symbolic destiny sign (58) that should be got and experienced in 
  the subsequent birth-place. </li>
</ul>

<p>Thereafter attending to that object thus presented (59), the stream of 
consciousness, in accordance with the Kamma that is to be matured, whether pure 
or corrupted, and in conformity with the place where one is to be born, 
continually flows, inclining mostly towards that state. Or that 
birth-reproductive Kamma presents itself to a sense-door in the way of renewing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 12. To one who is nearing death, either at the end of a thought-process or 
at the dissolution of bhavanga, the decease-consciousness, the consummation of 
the present life, arises and ceases in the way of death. </p>

<p>Immediately after that (death-consciousness) has ceased, a rebirth 
consciousness arises and is established in the subsequent existence, based on 
the object thus obtained, either with or without the heart-base (60) as is 
appropriate, generated by Kamma <i>(sankhāra)</i> that is enveloped by latent 
ignorance and rooted in latent craving. That rebirth (or relinking) 
consciousness, so called because it links together the two consecutive 
existences, is conjoined with its mental co-adjuncts, and acts as the 
fore-runner to the conascent states as their locus (or foundation - <i>
adhitthānabhāvena).
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    </i><p>§ 13. Herein in the dying thought-process only five feeble moments 
(normally seven thought-moments), of <i>javana</i> should be expected. </p>

<p>Therefore when death occurs while the present object is being presented to 
the avenues (i.e., <i>kamma nimitta</i> to one of the five sense-doors or <i>
gati nimitta</i> to the mind-door) then the rebirth-consciousness and the <i>
bhavanga</i>-consciousness take a present object. </p>

<p>Thus in rebirth in a Sense-Sphere the <i>kamma nimitta</i> taken by (any of) 
the six doors, or the <i>gati nimitta,</i> may be past or present. </p>

<p>But Kamma is perceived by the mind-door only as a past object. </p>

<p>All these should be regarded as lesser objects (i.e., belonging to the <i>
kāma</i>-sphere).
</p>

<p>In rebirth in the Realms of Forms the Kamma symbol which is a concept (such 
as earth device, etc.) becomes the object. </p>

<p>So, too, in rebirth in Formless Realms, only a Kamma symbol which is a 
sublimated concept (such as a visualized space) becomes an object, according to 
circumstances. </p>

<p>To the mindless beings only the vital nonad* establishes itself in the way of 
rebirth. Hence they are called materially reborn. Those born in Formless Realms 
are called mentally reborn. The rest are called materially and mentally reborn. </p>

<font SIZE="2">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

<p>* Namely, the four elements of extension, cohesion, heat, motion <i>(pathavi, 
āpo, tejo, vāyo), </i>the four derivatives - colour, odour, taste, nutritive 
essence <i>(vanna, gandha, rasa, ojā), </i>and physical life principle <i>
(jīvitindriya)</i></font></p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 14. After one passes away from a Formless Realm, one is similarly born in a 
Formless Realm, but not in a lower Formless plane, and also in the Sense-Sphere 
with three roots. </p>

<p>When one passes from a Realm of Form, one is not born without the three 
roots. After a birth with the three roots one seeks rebirth in all states. The 
rest (namely those with two roots and no roots) are reborn in the Sense-Spheres. </p>

<p>Herein this is the procedure with regard to decease and rebirth. </p>

<a name='8-10' href='?#8-10'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>51. &quot;Death is the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon.&quot; By death is meant 
the extinction of psychic life <i>(jīvitindriya),</i> heat <i>(usma = 
tejodhātu),</i> and consciousness <i>(viññāna),</i> of one individual in a 
particular existence. Death is not the complete annihilation of a being. Death 
in one place means birth in another place, just as, in conventional terms, the 
rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another place. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52. What are commonly understood to be natural deaths due to old age may be 
classed under this category. </p>

<p>To each of the various planes of existence is naturally assigned a definite 
age-limit, irrespective of the potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma that 
has yet to run. One must, however, succumb to death when the maximum age-limit 
is reached. It may also be said that if the Reproductive Kamma is extremely 
powerful, the Karmic energy rematerializes itself on the same plane, or on some 
higher plane as in the case of the devas. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. As a rule the thought, volition, or desire, which was extremely strong 
during lifetime becomes predominant at the moment of death, and conditions the 
subsequent birth. In this last thought-moment is present a special potentiality. 
When the potential energy of this Reproductive Kamma is exhausted, the organic 
activities of the material form, in which is corporealized the life-force, cease 
even before the approach of old age. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>54. If a person is born at a time when the age-limit is 80 years, and he dies 
at 80 owing to the exhaustion of the potential force of his Reproductive Kamma, 
his death is due to the simultaneous expiration of both age and Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>55. There are powerful actions which suddenly cut off the force of the 
Reproductive Kamma, even before the expiration of the life-term. A more powerful 
opposing force, for instance, can check the path of a flying arrow and bring it 
down to the ground. Similarly, a very powerful Kammic force of the past is 
capable of nullifying the potential energy of the dying reproductive <i>(janaka)</i> 
thought-moment, and thus destroy the life of a being. The death of Devadatta was 
due to an <i>upacchedaka</i> <i>kamma</i> which he committed during his 
lifetime. </p>

<p>The first three types of death are collectively called <i>kālamarana</i>
(timely death), and the last one is known as akālamarana (untimely death). </p>

<p>An oil lamp, for instance, may be extinguished owing to any of the following 
four causes, namely, the exhaustion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, 
simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil, and some extraneous cause like the 
gust of a wind. Death of a person may similarly be caused by any of the 
aforesaid four ways.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>56. As a person is about to die, a good or bad action may present itself 
before his mind&#39;s eye. It may be either a meritorious or a demeritorious Weighty 
action <i>(garuka kamma), </i>such as <i>jhānas</i> (ecstasies), or parricide 
etc. They are so powerful that they totally eclipse all other actions, and 
appear very vividly before the mental eye. If there is no Weighty action, he may 
take for his object of the dying thought a Kamma done or remembered immediately 
before death <i>(āsanna kamma). </i></p>

<p>If it is a past action, strictly speaking, it is the good or bad thought 
experienced at the moment of performing the action, that recurs at the 
death-moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>57. <b>Kamma nimitta</b> is any sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea 
which was obtained at the time of the commission of the Kamma, such as knives in 
the case of a butcher, patients in the case of a physician, flowers in the case 
of a devotee, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>58. By <b>gati nimitta</b> is meant some sign of the place where he is to 
take birth, an event which invariably happens to dying persons. When these 
indications of the future birth occur, and if they are bad, they can be turned 
into good. This is done by influencing the thoughts of the dying person, so that 
his good thoughts may now act as the Proximate Kamma and counteract the 
influence of the Reproductive Kamma which would otherwise affect his subsequent 
birth. </p>

<p>These symbols of one&#39;s destiny may be hellish fires, forests, mountainous 
regions, mother&#39;s womb, celestial mansions, etc. </p>

<p>The Kamma is presented to the mind-door. <i>Kamma nimitta</i> may be 
presented to any of the six doors according to circumstances. <i>Gati nimitta,</i> 
being always a physical sight, is presented to the mind-door as a dream. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>59. Taking one of the aforesaid objects, a thought-process runs its course 
even if the death be an instantaneous one. It is said that even the fly which is 
crushed by a hammer on the anvil also experiences such a thought-process before 
it actually dies. </p>

<p>Let us imagine for the sake of convenience that the dying person is to be 
reborn in the human plane and that his object is some good Kamma. </p>

<p>His <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness, interrupted, vibrates for one 
thought-moment and passes away. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending 
consciousness <i>(manodvārāvajjana)</i>
arises and passes away. Then comes the psychologically important stage - the <i>
javana</i>
process - which here runs only for five thought-moments by reason of its 
weakness, instead of the normal seven. As such it lacks all reproductive power; 
its main function being the mere regulation of the new existence - <i>
abhinavakarana.</i> The object in the present case being desirable, the 
consciousness he experiences is a moral one - automatic or prompted, accompanied 
by pleasure, and associated with wisdom or as the case may be. The <i>
tadālambana</i>
consciousness which has for its function a registering or identifying for two 
moments of the object so perceived, may or may not follow. After this occurs 
death consciousness <i>(cuti citta), </i>the last thought-moment to be 
experienced in this present life. (See Diagram XI). </p>

<p>There is a misconception amongst some that the subsequent birth is 
conditioned by this last decease-thought. What actually conditions rebirth is 
not this decease-thought, which in itself has no special function to perform, 
but that which is experienced during the <i>javana</i> process. </p>

<p>With the ceasing of the decease-consciousness death actually occurs. Then no 
material qualities born of mind and food <i>(cittaja</i> and <i>āhāraja rūpa)</i>
are produced. Only series of material qualities born of heat <i>(utuja)</i> goes 
on till the corpse is reduced to dust. </p>

<p>Now, immediately after the dissolution of the decease consciousness <i>(cuti 
citta)</i> there arises in a fresh existence the re-linking consciousness <i>
(patisandhi viññāna).</i> This is followed by sixteen <i>bhavanga</i> 
thought-moments. Thereafter the mind-door apprehending consciousness <i>
(manodvārāvajjana)</i> arises, to be followed by seven <i>javana</i> 
thought-moments, developing a liking to the fresh existence <i>(bhavanikanti 
javana). </i>Then the <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness arises and perishes, and the 
stream of consciousness flows on ceaselessly (see Diagram XII). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>60. In the case of Formless Realms there is no heart-base <i>(hadayavatthu).</i></p>

<p>V. The Stream of Consciousness</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 15. So, to those who have thus got rebirth, immediately after the cessation 
of the re-linking (consciousness) (61) a similar consciousness, depending on the 
same object, flows on, in the absence of a thought-process, uninterruptedly like 
a stream (62), until the arising of the decease-consciousness (63). Being an 
essential factor of life, this consciousness is known as <i>bhavanga.</i> At the 
end, in the way of dying, it arises as decease-consciousness (64) and perishes. 
Thereafter the re-linking-consciousness and others, revolving according to 
circumstances like a wheel, continue to exist. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 16. Just as here, so again in the subsequent existence there arise 
re-linking consciousness, life-continuum, thought-processes, and 
decease-consciousness. Again with rebirth and life continuum this stream of 
consciousness turns round. </p>

<p>The enlightened, disciplining themselves long, understanding the impermanence 
(of life), will realize the Deathless State (i.e., Nibbāna), and, completely 
cutting off the fetters of attachment, attain Peace*. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>61. <i>Patisandhi, bhavanga,</i> and <i>cuti</i> consciousness of one 
particular existence are identical as they have the same object. The mental 
states in each of these three are the same. They differ only in name and in 
function. Immediately after the rebirth-consciousness <i>bhavanga</i>-consciousness 
arises. During lifetime, whenever no thought-processes arise, this <i>bhavanga</i> 
consciousness exists. One experiences innumerable <i>bhavanga</i> 
thought-moments in the course of one&#39;s lifetime. </p>

<p>62. Note the Pāli phrase <i>nadī soto viya.</i> </p>

<p>63. <i>Cuti citta</i> or decease-consciousness, which one experiences at the 
moment of death, is similar to the <i>patisandhi citta</i> and <i>bhavanga citta</i>
of that particular life. </p>

<p>64. Immediately after the decease consciousness there arises in a subsequent 
rebirth the re-linking or rebirth consciousness <i>(patisandhi citta),</i> at 
the moment of conception. </p>

<p>The sixth chapter is confined mainly to <i>rūpa</i> and Nibbāna.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight species of Rūpa are enumerated. What they are, how they arise, 
persist, and perish, are also explained. <i>Rūpa</i> is the third <i>paramattha</i>
mentioned in the Abhidhamma, and is one of the two composite factors of this 
so-called being - the other being <i>nāma</i> (mind). As <i>nāma,</i> so <i>rūpa</i> 
too has been microscopically analysed. But no logical definition of <i>rūpa</i> 
is found either in the Text or in the Commentaries. </p>

<p><i>Rūpa</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>rup, </i>to break 
up, to perish<i> (nāsa). </i></p>

<p>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā, <i>rūpa</i> is that which transforms or 
assumes a different mode owing to the adverse physical conditions of cold heat, 
etc. <i>(sītonhādi virodhippaccayehi vikāram āpajjati). </p>

<p></i>From a Buddhist standpoint <i>rūpa</i> not only changes but also perishes <i>
(khaya, vaya).</i> It endures only for seventeen thought-moments. <i>Rūpa</i>
changes so rapidly that one cannot strike an identical place twice. </p>

<p><i>Rūpa</i> is also explained as that which manifests itself <i>(<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> 
rup - pakāsane).</i> </p>

<p>Scholars suggest various renderings for <i>rūpa.</i> It is generally rendered 
by &#39;form&#39;, &#39;body&#39;, &#39;matter&#39;, &#39;corporeality&#39;, etc. meanings differ according to 
the context. One particular meaning is not universally applicable. </p>

<p>From a philosophical standpoint, &#39;matter&#39; is the nearest equivalent for
<i>rūpa,</i> although scientists too find it difficult to define matter. </p>

<p>It should be noted that the atomic theory prevailed in India in the time of 
the Buddha. <i>Paramānu</i> was the ancient term for the modern atom. According 
to the ancient belief one <i>ratharenu</i> consists of 36 <i>tajjāris;</i> one <i>
tajjāri,</i>
36 <i>anus;</i> one <i>anu,</i> 36 <i>paramānus.</i> The minute particles of 
dust seen dancing in the sunbeam are called <i>ratharenus.</i> One <i>paramānu</i> 
is therefore, 1/46, 656th part of a <i>ratharenu.</i> This <i>paramānu</i> was 
considered indivisible. </p>

<p>With His supernormal knowledge the Buddha analysed this so-called <i>paramānu</i>
and declared that it consists of <i>paramatthas</i> - ultimate entities which 
cannot further be subdivided. </p>

<p>The <i>paramatthas</i> are <i>pathavi, āpo, tejo,</i> and <i>vāyo.</i>
One must not understand that these elements are earth, water, fire and air, as 
some Greek thinkers believed in the past. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Pathavi</b> means the element of extension, the substratum of matter. 
Without it objects cannot occupy space. The qualities of hardness and softness 
which are purely relative are two conditions of this particular element. It may 
be stated that this element is present in earth, water, fire and air. For 
instance, the water above is supported by water below. It is this element of 
extension in conjunction with the element of motion, that produces the upward 
pressure. Heat or cold is the <i>tejo</i>
element, while fluidity is the <i>āpo</i> element </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>āpo</b> is the element of cohesion. Unlike pathavi it is intangible. It is 
this element that makes scattered particles of matter cohere, and gives rise to 
the idea of &#39;body&#39;. When solid bodies are melted, this element becomes more 
prominent in the resulting fluid. This element is found even in minute particles 
when solid bodies are reduced to powder. The elements of extension and cohesion 
are so closely interrelated that when cohesion ceases extension disappears. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Tejo</b> is the element of heat. Cold is also a form of <i>tejo.</i>
Both heat and cold are included in <i>tejo</i> because they possess the power of 
maturing bodies, Tejo, in other words, is the vitalizing energy. Preservation 
and decay are also due to this element. Unlike the other three essentials of 
matter, this element has the power to regenerate matter by itself. </p>

<p>Inseparably connected with heat is <b>vāyo,</b> the element of motion. 
Movements are caused by this element. Motion is regarded as the force or the 
generator of heat. &quot;Motion and heat in the material realm correspond 
respectively to consciousness and Kamma in the mental.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These four elements coexist and are inseparable, but one may preponderate 
over another as, for instance, <i>pathavi</i> in earth, <i>āpo</i> in water,
<i>tejo</i> in fire, and <i>vāyo</i> in air. </p>

<p>They are also called Mahābhūtas, or Great Essentials because they are 
invariably found in all material substances ranging from the infinitesimally 
small cell to the most massive object. </p>

<p>Dependent on them are the four subsidiary material qualities of colour <i>
(vanna),</i>
smell <i>(gandha),</i> taste <i>(rasa),</i> and nutritive essence <i>(ojā).</i> 
These eight coexisting forces and qualities constitute one material group called <i>
&#39;suddhatthaka rūpa kalāpa</i> - pure-octad material group&#39;. </p>

<p>The remaining twenty kinds of <i>rūpa</i> are equally important. </p>

<p>It should be noted that physical life-principle <i>(rūpa jīvitindriya)</i> 
and sex are also conditioned by Kamma. Life in inorganic matter should be 
differentiated from life in animate beings. </p>

<p>The fact that <i>rūpas</i> arise in four ways such as Kamma, mind, seasonal 
phenomena, and food, will be a novel idea to modern thinkers. All these four 
sources can, to a great extent, be brought under one&#39;s control. </p>

<p>To some extent we are responsible for the creation of our own material 
phenomena, desirable or undesirable. </p>

<p>The accumulated Karmic tendencies created by persons in the course of their 
previous lives, play at times a greater role than the hereditary parental cells 
and genes, in the formation of physical characteristics.</p>

<p>The Buddha, for instance, inherited like every other person, the reproductive 
cells and genes from His parents. But physically there was none comparable to 
Him in His long line of honorable ancestors. In the Buddha&#39;s own words, He 
belonged not to the royal lineage, but to that of the Aryan Buddhas. He was 
certainly a superman, an extraordinary creation of His own Kamma.</p>

<p>According to the Lakkhana Sutta (D. 30) the Buddha inherited these 
exceptional features, such as the 32 major marks, as the result of his past 
meritorious deeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical feature is 
clearly explained in the Sutta. </p>

<p>In the sixth chapter only a few lines are devoted to the fourth <i>paramattha</i>
- Nibbāna - the <i>summum bonum</i> of Buddhism. But the path to Nibbāna is 
described in detail in the ninth chapter. </p>

<p>The seventh chapter enumerates all ethical states and classifies them into 
various groups. </p>

<p>The two most profound philosophical teachings of Buddhism - namely, the Law 
of Dependent Arising <i>(paticca-samuppāda)</i> and the twenty-four Causal 
Relations<i>
(Patthāna) </i>are described in the eighth chapter. </p>

<p>The last chapter is the most important and the most interesting, as it deals 
with Mental Culture <i>(bhāvanā)</i> and Emancipation, the quintessence of 
Buddhism. </p>

<p>To understand the intricacies of Abhidhamma one should critically read and 
reread the Abhidhammattha Sangaha patiently and carefully, pondering at the same 
time on the profound teachings embodied therein. </p>

<p>One who understands the Abhidhamma well can fully comprehend the Word of the 
Buddha and thereby realize one&#39;s ultimate goal. </p>

<p>Analysis of Matter</b></font></p>

<b>

<p>Introductory</b></p>

<p>§ 1. Having thus far described the consciousness and mental states in 
accordance with their classes (1) and processes (2), matter will now be dealt 
with. </p>

<p>With respect to enumeration (3), divisions (4), arising (5), groups (6), and 
the mode of happening (7), the compendium of matter therein is fivefold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Enumeration of matter <i>(samuddesa)</i></b></p>

<p>§ 2. Matter is twofold-namely, the four Great Essentials (8), and material 
qualities derived from them (9). These two constitute eleven species. </p>

<p>How? </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(1) Essential material qualities - the element of extension (10), the 
  element of cohesion (11), the element of heat (12), and the element of motion 
  (13). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(2) Sensitive material qualities (14) viz: eye, ear, nose, tongue, and 
  body. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(3) Material objects (15), viz: form (16), sound, odour, taste, and 
  tangibility (17) - found in the three Essentials excluding the element of 
  cohesion. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(4) Material qualities of sex (18), viz: femininity and masculinity. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(5) Material quality of base, viz: the heart-base (19). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(6) Material quality of life, viz: vital principle (20), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(7) Material quality of nutrition, viz: edible food (21). </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus these eighteen (22) kinds of material qualities are grouped: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>(i) according to their innate characteristics (23), </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(ii) according to their respective marks (24). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(iii) as conditioned (25),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(iv) as changeable (26),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>(v) as (fit for) contemplation (27). </p>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p>(8) Limiting material quality, viz: the element of space (28). </p>
  <p>(9) Communicating material quality (29) - viz: - bodily intimation and 
  vocal intimation. </p>
  <p>(10) Mutable material qualities (30) - viz: - material lightness (31), 
  softness (32), adaptability (33), and the two forms of intimation. </p>
  <p>(11) Characteristics (34) of material qualities, viz: material 
  productivity, continuity, decay and impermanence. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here by productivity and continuity are meant the material quality of 
	birth.</p>
    <p>Thus the eleven kinds of material qualities are treated as twenty eight 
	according to their intrinsic properties. </p>
  </blockquote>

<p>How (twenty-eight)? </p>

<p>Essentials, sensory organs, objects, sex, heart, vitality, and food thus 
(matter) is eighteen fold. </p>

<p>Limitation (space), intimation, change-ability, and characteristics - thus 
there are ten non-conditioned (by kamma ). In all there are twenty-eight. </p>

<p>Herein this is the enumeration of matter. </p>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>1. The first three chapters dealt with different types of consciousness and 
mental states, both concisely and descriptively. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. The fourth chapter was confined to 7 thought-processes during lifetime, 
and the fifth chapter, to various planes and processes of rebirth consciousness.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Samuddesa</b> - i.e., the brief exposition of <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Vibhāga</b> - i.e., the analysis of <i>rūpa.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Samutthāna</b> - i.e., the arising of different constituents of <i>rūpa</i>
such as eye-decad, etc., caused by Kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and food. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Kalāpa</b> - the group compositions of rūpa, such as body-decad, 
sex-decad. etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Pavattikkama</b> - i.e., how <i>rūpas</i> take place in accordance with 
the states of existence, time, and classes of beings. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Mahābhūtāni</b> - lit ., those that have grown great. The four Great 
Essentials are the fundamental material elements which are inseparable. Every 
material substance, ranging from the minutest particle to the most massive 
object, consists of these four elements which possess specific characteristics. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Upādāya-rūpāni</b> - Derivative or secondary material properties 
dependent on the Great Essentials. Like the earth are the Essentials; the 
Derivatives are like trees that spring therefrom. The remaining 24 <i>rūpas</i> 
are regarded as Derivatives. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Pathavi-dhātu</b> - The Pāli term <i>dhātu</i> means that which bears 
its own characteristic marks. Element is the closest equivalent for <i>dhātu. 
Pathavi dhātu,</i> literally, means the earth-element. It is so called because 
like the earth it serves as a support or foundation for the other coexisting <i>
rūpas.</i> <i>Pathavi</i>
(Sanskrit: <i>prthivi),</i> also spelt <i>pathavi, puthavi, puthuvi, puthuvi</i> 
- is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>puth, </i>to expand, to 
extend. So far, though not very satisfactory, the closest equivalent for <i>
pathavi-dhātu</i> is &#39;the element of extension&#39;. Without it objects cannot 
occupy space. Both hardness and softness are characteristics of this element. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>āpo-dhātu</b> - lit., the fluid element . āpo is derived from
<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ap,</i> to arrive, or from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font>
pāy, </i>to grow, to increase. It is &#39;the element of cohesion . According to 
Buddhism it is this element that makes different particles of matter cohere, and 
thus prevents them from being scattered about. Both fluidity and contraction are 
the properties of this element. It should be understood that cold is not a 
characteristic of this element. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Tejo-dhātu</b> - lit., the fire-element, is explained as &#39;the element 
of heat&#39;. <i>Tejo</i> is derived from<i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> tij,</i> 
to sharpen, to mature. Vivacity and maturity are due to the presence of this 
element. Both heat and cold are the properties of <i>tejo.</i> Intense <i>tejo</i> 
is heat, and mild <i>tejo</i>
is cold. It should not be understood that cold is the characteristic of <i>āpo</i> 
and heat is that of <i>tejo;</i> for, in that case, both heat and cold should be 
found together, as <i>āpo</i> and <i>tejo</i> coexist. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Vāyo-dhātu</b> - lit., &#39;the air-element&#39;, is explained as the element 
of motion. <i>Vāyo</i> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vay,</i>
to move, to vibrate. Motion, vibration, oscillation, and pressure are caused by 
this element. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Pasāda-rūpa</b> - They are the sensitive parts of the five organs - 
eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. They tend to clarify the coexisting material 
qualities. The perceptible physical eye, for instance, is the <i>sasambhāra 
cakkhu</i> or composite eye, which consists of the four <i>bhūta-rūpas,</i> four <i>
upādā-rūpas</i>
(colour, odour, taste, and sap), and <i>jīvitindriya</i> (vitality). The 
sensitive part which lies at the center of the retina and which enables one to 
see objects is, the <i>cakkhu pasāda.</i> This is the basis of the 
eye-consciousness <i>(cakkhu-viññāna)</i> and becomes the instrument for the 
eye-door thought-process <i>(cakkhu-dvāravīthi).</i> The desire to see tends to 
develop the sense of sight. The eye, therefore, consists of ten material 
qualities of which <i>pasāda</i> is one.</p>

<p>The other <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> should be similarly understood. </p>

<p>The <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> of ear, nose, and tongue are in their respective 
centers; the <i>kāya-pasāda-rūpa</i> is diffused throughout the body except on 
hair, on the tips of nails, and in withered skin. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Gocararūpa</b> - The sense-fields which serve as supports for the 
sense-cognitions to arise. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Rūpa</b> - Both colour and shape are implied by this term. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Photthabba</b> - owing to its subtlety, the element of cohesion <i>
(āpo)</i>
cannot be felt by the sense of touch. Only the other three Fundamental Elements 
are regarded as tangible. In water, for instance, the cold felt is <i>tejo,</i> 
the softness is <i>pathavi,</i> and the pressure is <i>vāyo.</i> One cannot 
touch <i>āpo</i> as its property is cohesion. </p>

<p>See Compendium, p. 155, n. 6. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Itthattam purisattam</b> - also termed <i>itthindriyam, purisindriyam </i>
- are collectively called in the abbreviated form <i>bhāva-rūpa,</i>
the state by means of which masculinity and femininity are distinguished. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>Hadayavatthu</b> - The seat of consciousness. Dhammasangani omits this <i>
rūpa.</i> In the Atthasālini <i>hadayavatthu</i> is explained as <i>cittassa 
vatthu</i> (basis of consciousness). </p>

<p>It is clear that the Buddha did not definitely assign a specific seat for 
consciousness, as He has done with the other senses. It was the cardiac theory 
(the view that heart is the seat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, 
and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have 
accepted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Patthāna, 
the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such 
indirect terms as <i>&quot;yam rūpam nissāya&#39;&#39;</i>
&quot;depending on that material thing&quot;, without positively asserting whether that <i>
rūpa</i>
was either the heart <i>(hadaya)</i> or the brain. But, according to the views 
of commentators like Venerable Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha, the seat of 
consciousness is definitely the heart. It should be understood that the Buddha 
has neither accepted nor rejected this ancient popular cardiac theory. </p>

<p>See Compendium p. 156, n. 1, and p. 277. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Jīvitindriya</b> - There is vitality both in mind and in matter. 
Psychic life, which is one of the fifty-two mental states <i>(cetasikās),</i> 
and physical life, which is one of the twenty-eight <i>rūpas,</i> are essential 
characteristics of this so-called being. Psychic life is one of the seven 
universals and physical life is associated with almost every material group 
except in dead matter. Simultaneous with the arising of the 
rebirth-consciousness, physical life also springs up together with the initial 
material groups. <i>Jīvita</i> is qualified by <i>indriya</i>
because it has a dominating influence over other co-adjuncts in vivifying them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>Kabalīkāro āhāro</b> - so called because gross food is taken in by 
making into morsels. Here <i>āhāra</i> means nutritive essence <i>(ojā) </i>
which sustains the physical body. In the statement - <i>sabbe sattā 
āhāratthitikā,</i> all beings live on food - <i>āhāra</i> means a condition <i>
(paccaya). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. Eighteen - 5+4 (tangibility excluded), 2+1+1+1 = 18. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Sabhāva-rūpa</b> - With respect to their own peculiar characteristics 
such as hardness, fluidity, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Salakkhanarūpa</b> - So called because they arise with the inherent 
general marks of impermanence <i>(anicca), </i>suffering <i>(dukkha) </i>and 
soullessness <i>(anattā). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Nipphannarūpa</b> - i.e., produced by Kamma mind, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Rūparūpa</b> - Here the first term <i>rūpa</i> is used in its 
etymological sense, i.e., change-ableness, as in the Pāli phrase - <i>
dukkha-dukkha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Sammasanarūpa</b> - Because it enables one to employ them as objects 
fit for contemplation or insight. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>ākāsadhātu</b> - Ceylon Commentators derive <i>ākāsa</i>
from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> kas,</i> to plough. Since there is no 
ploughing as on earth, space is called <i>ākāsa</i>. According to Sanskrit, <i>
ākāsa</i> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> kās, </i>to view, 
to recognize. In Ledi Sayadaw&#39;s opinion it is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> kās, </i>to shine, to appear. <i>ākāsa</i> is space which in itself is 
nothingness. As such it is eternal. <i>ākāsa</i> is a dhātu in the sense of a 
non-entity <i>(nijjīva),</i> not as an existing element like the four 
Essentials. By <i>ākāsa,</i> as one of the 28 <i>rūpas,</i>
is meant not so much the outside space as the intra-atomic space that &#39;limits&#39; 
or separates material groups <i>(rūpakalāpas).</i> Hence in Abhidhamma it is 
regarded as a <i>&#39;pariccheda-rūpa&#39;.</i>
Although <i>ākāsa</i> is not an objective reality, as it is invariably 
associated with all material units that arise in four ways, Abhidhamma teaches 
that it, too, is produced by the same four causes such as Kamma, mind, seasonal 
changes. and food. Simultaneous with the arising and perishing of the 
conditioned <i>rūpas, ākāsa rūpa</i> also arises and perishes. </p>

<p>See Compendium p. 226. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Viññatti</b> is that by means of which one communicates one&#39;s ideas to 
another and one understands another&#39;s intentions. It is done both by action and 
speech - <i>kāya-viññatti</i> and <i>vacī-viññatti.</i> The former is caused by 
the &#39;air-element&#39; <i>(vāyo-dhātu) </i>produced by mind <i>(cittaja);</i> the 
latter by the &#39;earth-element produced by the mind. The duration of <i>viññatti</i> 
is only one thought-moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Vikārarūpa</b> - Change-ability of <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Lahutā</b> denotes physical health, and is comparable to an iron rod 
heated throughout the day. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Mudutā</b> is comparable to a well-beaten hide. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Kammaññatā</b> is opposed to the stiffness of the body, and is 
comparable to well-hammered gold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Lakkhanarūpa</b> - So called because they assume distinguishable 
characteristics at different stages, such as arising <i>(upāda),</i>
static <i>(thiti)</i> and dissolution <i>(bhanga).</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Upacaya</b> means the first heaping-up or the first arising. Here <i>&#39;upa&#39;</i>
is used in the sense of first. The arising of the first three decads - <i>kāya, 
bhāva,</i>
and <i>vatthu</i> - at the very moment of conception, is regarded as <i>upacaya.</i> 
The subsequent arising of the three decads from the static stage of 
rebirth-consciousness throughout lifetime is regarded as <i>santati.</i> Both <i>
upacaya</i> and <i>santati</i>
are sometimes treated as <i>jāti</i> - birth. Then the number of <i>rūpas</i> 
amounts to 27 instead of 28. </p>

<p>The life term of conditioned <i>rūpa</i> is normally 17 thought-moments or 51 
minor thought-instants (according to Commentators, during<font SIZE="2"> </font>
the time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments arise.)</p>

<p>The first thought-moment is like the <i>upacaya</i>, the last thought-moment 
is like the <i>aniccatā,</i> the intermediate 15 are like the <i>jaratā. 
Aniccatā</i> is the dissolution of <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, there are only three <i>lakkhanarūpas,</i> viz: birth, 
growth-decay, and death. <i>Aniccatā</i> is synonymous with <i>marana</i> 
(death). The entire interval between birth and death constitutes development or 
decay. </p>

<p>With the exception of the five <i>rūpas</i> - namely, two <i>viññattis, jāti, 
jarā,</i> and <i>aniccatā</i> - all the remaining 23 rūpas last for 17 
thought-moments. </p>

<p>Classification of Matter</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. Now all this matter divides itself into various categories as follows: </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>1. Rootless (35)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>2. Causal (36)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>3. With Defilements (37)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>4. Conditioned (38)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>5. Mundane (39)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>6. Pertaining to the Kāma-Sphere (40)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>7. Objectless (41)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>8. Not to be eradicated (42)</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matter is thus one-fold. When conceived as personal, external, and so forth, 
matter becomes manifold. </p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>The five kinds of sensitive material qualities are personal (43); the rest 
are external. </p>

<p>The six kinds, comprising the sensitives and the heart, are material 
qualities with basis (44); the rest are without a basis. </p>

<p>The seven kinds, comprising the sensitives and (the two) media of 
communication, are material qualities with a door (45); the rest are without 
doors. </p>

<p>The eight kinds, comprising the sensitives, sex-states, and vitality, are 
material qualities with a controlling faculty (46); the rest are without a 
controlling faculty. </p>

<p>The twelve kinds, comprising the sensitives and (seven) sense-objects 
(because &quot;tangibility&quot; comprises the three elements, excluding <i>āpo)</i>, are 
gross (47), proximate, and impinging material qualities; the rest are subtle, 
distant, and non-impinging. </p>

<p>Material qualities born of Kamma are &#39;grasped at&#39; (48); the others are &#39;not 
grasped at&#39;. </p>

<p>Object of form is visible; the rest are invisible. </p>

<p>Eye and ear, as not reaching (the object), and nose, tongue and body, as 
reaching (the object), are five kinds of material phenomena that take objects 
(49); the others do not. </p>

<p>Colour, odour, taste, sap (50), and the four Essentials are the eight kinds 
(51) of material phenomena that are inseparable; the rest are separable. </p>

<p><b></p>

<p>Summary</b></p>

<p>Thus the wise analyze, accordingly, the 28 kinds with respect to &#39;personal&#39; 
and so forth. </p>

<p>Herein this is the analysis of Matter. </p>

<a name='3-5' href='?#3-5'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>35. <b>Ahetukam</b> - Because they are not associated with the roots <i>
lobha, dosa,</i> etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Sappaccayam</b> - Because they are related to the causes - Kamma. <i>
citta, utu,</i> and <i>āhāra.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Sāsavam</b> - Since they serve as objects for Defilements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Sankhatam</b> - Because they are conditioned by the four causes - 
Kamma, <i>citta,</i> etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Lokiyam</b> - Because they are connected with the world of the Five 
Aggregates of Attachment <i>(pañcupādānakkhandhaloka). </i>There is no 
supramundane <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Kāmāvacaram</b> - Because they come within the range of sensual 
objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Anārammanam</b> - As they themselves do not perceive objects. It is 
the mind that perceives objects through the senses. Rūpas serve as 
sense-objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <b>Appahātābbam</b> - Because there is no gradual eradication of matter 
like passions. &#39;Indestructibility&#39; of matter is not implied by this term. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. <b>Ajjhattikam</b> - Belonging to the so-called self. The five sensitive 
organs are essential for living beings. Without them they are inanimate logs. 
They serve as doors to the mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. i.e., they serve as seats of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. They serve as doors to moral and immoral actions, mind and mental states, 
deeds and speech. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. They are so called because they possess a controlling power in their 
respective spheres. The physical eye, for instance, is composed of ten material 
qualities; but it is the sensitive eye <i>(cakkhupasādarūpa) </i>that controls 
the remaining nine. The remaining <i>pasādarūpas</i> should be similarly 
understood. The state of sex controls masculinity and femininity. Like the 
captain of a ship it is vitality that controls <i>rūpas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. <b>Olārikam</b> - Because of their importance both subjectively and 
objectively. They are regarded as <i>santike</i> (near) because of their 
receptivity. Owing to the grossness and nearness both sensitive organs and 
sense-objects mutually strike each other. Hence they are called <i>sappatigha,</i> 
lit., &#39;with striking against&#39;.</p>

<p>See Compendium p. 159, n. 4. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>48. <b>Upādinnam</b> - The first 18 kinds of <i>rūpa</i> born of Kamma are 
grasped by craving and false view. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>49. <b>Gocaraggāhikarūpam</b> - They are so called because they take external 
objects as pasture. According to the Abhidhammattha Sangaha, sight and sound are 
regarded as objects that do not approach the eye and ear respectively as in the 
case of bodily contacts, etc. Both eye and ear cognize distant objects without 
any direct approach. In the case of other objects they directly contact the 
sense-organs. For instance, taste must directly touch the tongue. So are the 
other two objects. This may be the reason, irrespective of the wave theory, why 
the author distinguishes between senses that reach, and do not reach, the 
objects. </p>

<p>See Compendium, p. 160. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>50. <b>Ojā,</b> as a <i>rūpa</i> in itself, has the power of producing other <i>
rūpas</i> as well. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>51. As a rule these eight <i>rūpas</i> are bound together. The four 
Essentials are inseparable and so are the four Derivatives. Hence they are also 
termed <i>&#39;suddhatthaka&#39;</i>
(&#39;pure octad&#39;) and <i>&#39;ojatthaka&#39;</i> (&#39;with ojā as the eighth&#39;). The growth of 
inanimate matter is also due to the presence of this universal <i>ojā</i>. </p>

<p>The Arising of Material Phenomena (52)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. Material phenomena arise in four ways, viz:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>1. Kamma, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>2. Mind, </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>3. Seasonal Conditions, and </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>4. Food.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Material Phenomena arising from Kamma (53) </b></p>

<p>Therein, the twenty-five types of moral and immoral Kamma, pertaining to the <i>
kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i> Spheres, produce ,in one&#39;s own continuity, duly 
constituted material phenomena born of Kamma, at every moment, commencing from 
conception.
</p>

<p><b></p>

<p>2. Material Phenomena arising from Mind (54) </b></p>

<p>The seventy-five types of consciousness, excluding the Formless Resultants 
and the twice fivefold cognitives, produce mind-born material phenomena, from 
the first moment of life-continuum just as it arises. </p>

<p>Therein the ecstatic <i>javanas</i> regulate the bodily postures. But the 
Determining Consciousness, <i>javanas</i> of the <i>kāma</i> Sphere, and 
Super-knowledge Consciousness, produce also (bodily and vocal) media of 
communication. Herein the thirteen pleasurable <i>javanas</i> produce laughter 
too. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>

<p>3. Material Phenomena arising from Seasonal Conditions (55) </b></p>

<p>The <i>tejo</i>-element, which comprises both cold and heat, on reaching its 
static stage, produces, according to circumstances, both internal and external 
material phenomena, resulting from seasonal conditions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>

<p>4. Material Phenomena arising from Food (56) </b></p>

<p>Food, known as nutritive essence, during assimilation on reaching its static 
stage, produces material phenomena resulting from food.</p>

<p>Therein the heart and the (eight) material Faculties are born of Kamma. The 
two media of communication are born only of mind. Sound is born of mind and 
seasonal conditions. The triple qualities of lightness and so forth arise from 
seasonal conditions, mind, and food. The inseparable material qualities and the 
element of space arise from four causes. Characteristic material qualities do 
not arise from any cause. </p>

<p>Eighteen, fifteen, thirteen, and twelve arise respectively from Kamma, mind, 
seasonal conditions, and food. </p>

<p>The characteristic marks of matter that arise and so forth are not produced 
by any cause, they say, since they are wholly intrinsic. </p>

<a name='3-8' href='?#3-8'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>52. <b>Rhūpasamutthana</b> - Buddhism does not attempt to solve the problem 
of the ultimate origin of matter. It takes for granted that matter exists and 
states that <i>rūpa</i> develops in four ways. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. <b>Kammaja</b> - Strictly speaking, by Kamma are meant past moral and 
immoral types of consciousness. It is only those classes of consciousness 
pertaining to the <i>kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i>-spheres that tend to produce <i>
rūpa.</i> They are 12 types of immoral consciousness, 8 types of moral 
consciousness, and the 5 moral <i>rūpa jhānas.</i> A moral or immoral 
birth-reproductive Kamma generated at the dying moment of a person, conditions 
the rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi-citta)</i> in a subsequent birth. 
Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth-consciousness, <i>rūpas</i>
conditioned by past Kamma spring up at every instant, like the flame of a lamp, 
up to the 17th thought-moment reckoned from the dying moment of the person. </p>

<p>At the very moment of conception there arise, as a result of the reproductive 
Karmic force, three <i>dasakas</i> or &#39;decads&#39; - namely, the <i>kāya, bhāva,</i> 
and <i>vatthu</i> - body, sex, and base decads. The body decad is composed of 
the four elements, four derivatives, vitality and the <i>kāyapasāda.</i> The 
sex-decad and the base-decad are similarly constituted. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>54. <b>Cittaja</b> - Mind, the invisible but more powerful composite factor 
of the so-called being, has the potentiality to produce <i>rūpa.</i> In other 
words, good and bad thoughts produce desirable and undesirable material 
phenomena. This is apparent from the physical changes that result from thoughts 
generated by a person. According to Abhidhamma, it is from the arising moment of 
the first <i>bhavanga,</i> that is, immediately after the rebirth-consciousness, 
that material phenomena arising from mind spring up. The rebirth-consciousness 
does not produce mind-born <i>rūpas,</i> since Kamma does that function, and 
since it is a newcomer to the fresh existence. No mind-born <i>rūpas</i>
arise at the static and perishing thought-moments, as they are weak. The ten 
sense-cognitives lack the potentiality to produce <i>rūpa.</i> The four <i>arūpa 
vipāka</i>
<i>jhānas</i> do not produce <i>rūpa,</i> as they are developed through 
non-attachment to <i>rūpa. </i></p>

<p>It is stated that <i>jhāna</i> factors are essential to produce mind-born <i>
rūpa.</i> One who possesses <i>jhānas</i> can therefore produce powerful <i>
rūpas</i>
which would enable him to live even without edible food. The mentally alert do 
not lack vitality. One who experiences Nibbānic bliss could live without any 
food for a considerable period. For instance, the Buddha fasted 49 days 
immediately after His Enlightenment. </p>

<p>Of the 75 types of consciousness, 26 <i>javanas</i> (10 <i>rūpa kusala</i>
and <i>kriyā,</i> 8 <i>arūpa kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> and 8 <i>lokuttaras)</i> 
could produce abnormal bodily movements such as passing through the air, diving 
into the earth, walking on water, etc. </p>

<p>Here the Determining consciousness is the mind-door consciousness <i>
(manodvārāvajjana).</i>
29 <i>kāma-javanas</i> are the 12 <i>akusalas,</i> 1 <i>hasituppāda,</i> and 16 <i>
sobhana kusala</i> and <i>kriyā;</i> and <i>abhiññā cittas</i> are the two fifth <i>
jhāna kusala</i> and <i>kriyā,</i> accompanied by equanimity and connected with 
knowledge. </p>

<p>13 pleasurable <i>javanas</i> are the 4 <i>akusalas</i> and 8 <i>sobhana 
kusalas</i> and <i>kriyās,</i> accompanied by pleasure, and one <i>hasituppāda.</i> </p>

<p>Worldlings, when laughing or smiling, experience the four <i>akusalas</i>
and four <i>sobhanas;</i> Sekhas, the same types of consciousness excluding the 
two <i>akusalas</i>
accompanied by misbelief; Arahats, the four <i>kriyās</i> and one <i>
hasituppāda.</i>
The Buddhas smile only with the four <i>sobhana kriyās.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>55. <b>Utuja</b> - It was stated earlier that Kamma produces, at the moment 
of rebirth, three decads <i>kāya, bhāva,</i> and <i>vatthu.</i> The internal <i>
tejo</i>
element, found in these three groups, combined with the external <i>tejo</i> 
element, produces material phenomena caused by seasonal conditions at the static 
stage of the rebirth-consciousness. At the genetic stage Kamma-born <i>tejo</i> 
element takes the place of mind-born <i>tejo</i> element. </p>

<p>It is clear that the term <i>utu</i> has been used in the sense of <i>tejo</i>
which constitutes both heat and cold. Strictly speaking, it is the internal and 
external <i>tejo</i>
elements which produce <i>rūpa.</i> It should be understood that <i>rūpas</i> 
produced by climatic conditions are also included in the <i>utuja</i> class. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>56. <b>āharaja</b> - By āhāra are meant the nutritive essence present in 
physical food and the sap <i>(ojā)</i> contained in the material groups born of 
Kamma, mind, and seasonal conditions. The internal <i>ojā,</i> supported by the 
external nutritive essence, produces <i>rūpa</i> at the static stage which 
endures for 49 minor thought-instants. <i>Rūpas</i> arise when the <i>ojā</i> 
diffuses the body. Internal sap is alone incapable of producing <i>rūpa</i> 
without the aid of external nutritive essence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Hadaya</b> and 8 <i>indriya rūpas</i> (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, 
masculinity, feminity, and vitality) are wholly produced by Kamma. Thus <i>
jīvitindriya</i>
or the life-principle present in animate beings such as men and animals should 
be differentiated from the inanimate life of plants and inorganic substances as 
they are not the inevitable results of Kamma. </p>

<p>They do possess a certain kind of life different from human beings and 
animals. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>ākāsa</b> - It is interesting to note that this inter-atomic space is 
caused by all the four causes. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Sadda</b> - Articulate sounds are caused by mind; inarticulate sounds are 
caused by <i>utu.</i> Musical notes caused by men are produced by <i>utu,</i>
conditioned by mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Kammaja</b> = 18. They are: 8 inseparables + 1 Space + 1 Heart + 8 
Controlling faculties . </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Cittaja</b> = 15. They are: 5 Mutables + 1 Sound + 8 Inseparables + 1 
Space. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Utuja</b> = 13. They are: 1 Sound + Lightness, etc. 3 + 8 Inseparables + 1 
Space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>āhāraja</b> = 12. They are: Lightness, etc. 3 + 8 Inseparables + 1 Space . 
The four <i>lakkhana rūpas</i> are common to all as there is no <i>rūpa</i>
devoid of the three instants birth, decay, and death. </p>

<p>Grouping of Material Qualities (57)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 5. There are twenty-one material groups inasmuch as they arise together (or 
have a common genesis), cease together (or have a common cessation), have a 
common dependence, and coexist. </p>

<p>Therein vitality and the (eight) inseparable material qualities together with 
the eye are called the &#39;eye-decad&#39;. Similarly the &#39;ear-decad&#39; together with the 
ear and so forth, &#39;nose-decad&#39;, &#39;tongue-decad&#39;, &#39;body-decad&#39;, &#39;female-decad&#39;, 
&#39;male-decad&#39;, &#39;base-decad&#39;, should respectively be formed. Inseparably material 
qualities, together with vitality, are called the &#39;vital nonad&#39;. These nine 
groups are produced by Kamma. </p>

<p>The inseparable material qualities constitute the &#39;pure octad&#39;. They, 
together with the bodily intimation, constitute the &#39;bodily intimation nonad&#39;; 
together with the vocal intimation and sound, the &#39;vocal intimation decad&#39;; 
together with the material qualities of lightness, pliancy, and adaptability, 
the &#39;un-decad of lightness&#39; and so forth; the dodecad of bodily intimation, 
lightness, pliancy, and adaptability; and the tridecad of vocal intimation, 
sound, lightness, pliancy, and adaptability. </p>

<p>These six material groups are produced by mind. </p>

<p>The pure octad, the sound-nonad, the un-decad of lightness, pliancy, and 
adaptability; the dodecad of sound, lightness, pliancy, and adaptability-these 
four are produced by seasonal phenomena. </p>

<p>The pure octad, and the un-decad of lightness, pliancy and adaptability are 
the two material qualities produced by food. </p>

<p>Of them the two material groups produced by seasonal phenomena - pure octad 
and the sound, nonad - are found externally too. All the rest are strictly 
internal.
</p>

<p>There are twenty-one material groups - nine, six, four and two produced in 
due order from Kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and food. </p>

<p>As space demarcates, and characteristic marks just indicate, the wise state 
that they are not parts of material groups. </p>

<p>Herein this is the formation of material groups. </p>

<p>Arising of Material Phenomena (58)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 6. All these material qualities are obtained, with no deficiency, according 
to circumstances, during lifetime in the <i>kāma</i>-sphere. But at conception, 
to moisture-born beings and to those of spontaneous birth, there arise at most 
the seven decads - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, sex and base. As a minimum 
sometimes, eye, ear, nose, and sex decads are not obtained. This is how 
deficiencies of material groups should be understood. </p>

<p>To the womb-born creatures there arise three decads - body, sex and base. 
Sometimes, however, the sex-decad is not obtained. From the conception and 
thereafter, during lifetime, gradually there arise eye-decads and so forth. </p>

<p>Thus the continuity of material groups produced in four ways - namely, 
Kamma-born from the time of conception, mind-born from the second moment of 
consciousness, season-born from the time of the static stage, food-born from the 
time of the diffusion of nutritive essence - uninterruptedly flows on in the <i>
kāma</i>-sphere till the end of life, like the flame of a lamp, or the stream of 
a river. </p>

<p>But at the time of death, from the seventeenth moment, reckoned backward from 
the decease-consciousness starting from the static stage of consciousness, 
kamma-born material phenomena no longer arise. Kamma-born material qualities 
that arose earlier exist till the decease-moment and then cease. Following that, 
the consciousness-born and nutriment-born material phenomena come to cessation. 
Thereafter a continuity of material qualities produced by physical changes 
persists while what is called a corpse lasts. </p>

<p>Thus to the dead persons, again in a subsequent life, material qualities 
similarly arise starting from the conception. </p>

<p>In the <i>rūpa</i>-plane decads of nose, tongue, body, sex and the material 
groups produced by food do not arise. Therefore to them at the time of rebirth 
there arise four material groups produced by Kamma, such as the three decads of 
eye, ear, and base, and the vital nonad. During life material qualities produced 
by mind and physical changes arise. </p>

<p>But to the mindless beings there do not arise eye, ear, base and sound. 
Similarly mind-born material qualities do not arise. Therefore at the moment of 
their rebirth only the vital nonad arises. During lifetime material qualities 
produced by physical changes, with the exception of sound, continue. </p>

<p>Thus in the three planes of <i>kāma, rūpa</i> and <i>asañña</i>
(Mindless) the procedure of material phenomena should be understood in two ways 
as regards rebirth and lifetime. </p>

<p>In the <i>kāma</i>-sphere are obtained 28 material qualities, 23 in the <i>
rūpa</i>-plane, 17 in the <i>asañña</i>-plane, but none in the <i>arūpa</i>-plane.
</p>

<p>At the moment of birth, sound, mutation, decay and impermanence are not 
obtained. During lifetime there is nothing that is not obtained. </p>

<p>Herein this is the way how material qualities arise.</p>

<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nibbāna (59)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 7. Nibbāna however is termed supramundane, and is to be realized by the 
wisdom of the Four Paths. It becomes an object to the Paths and Fruits, and is 
called Nibbāna because it is a departure <i>(ni)</i> from cord-like, <i>(vāna</i>) 
craving. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is onefold according to its intrinsic nature. </p>

<p>According to the way (it is experienced) it is twofold - namely, the element 
of Nibbāna with the substrata remaining, and the element of Nibbāna without the 
substrata remaining. </p>

<p>It is threefold according to its different aspects, namely, Void (60), 
Signless (61), and Longing-free (62). </p>

<p>Great seers who are free from craving declare that Nibbāna is an objective 
state (63) which is deathless, absolutely endless, non-conditioned (64), and 
incomparable.</p>

<p>Thus, as fourfold the Tathāgatas reveal the Ultimate Entities-consciousness 
mental states, matter, and Nibbāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Abhidhamma Compendium this is the sixth chapter, which deals with the 
analysis of matter. </p>

<a name='3-13' href='?#3-13'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

<p>57. <i>Rūpas</i> do not arise singly but collectively in groups. There are 21 
such material groups. </p>

<p>As all mental states possess four common characteristics, so <i>rūpas</i>
found in the aforesaid groups possess four salient characteristics. For 
instance, in the &#39;eye-decad&#39; all the ten associated <i>rūpas</i> arise and cease 
together <i>(ekuppāda-ekanirodha).
</i>The earth-element, which is one of the ten, acts as a basis for the 
remaining nine <i>(ekanissaya).</i>
All these ten coexist <i>(sahavutti). </i>It should be understood that the 
earth-element of the &#39;eye-decad&#39; does not serve as a basis for the associated <i>
rūpas</i> of the &#39;ear-decad&#39;. These four characteristics apply only to the 
associated <i>rūpas</i> of each particular group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>58. This section deals with the manner in which these material groups come 
into being and how they exist during lifetime, at the moment of conception, and 
in different states of birth.</p>

<p>According to Buddhism there are four kinds of birth - namely, egg-born beings <i>
(andaja),</i> womb-born beings <i>(jalābuja),</i> moisture-born beings <i>
(samsedaja),
</i>and beings having spontaneous births <i>(opapātika).</i> </p>

<p>Embryos that take moisture as nidus for their growth, like certain lowly 
forms of animal life, belong to the third class. </p>

<p>Sometimes moisture-born beings lack certain senses and have no sex. They all 
must possess a consciousness as they are all endowed with the base-decad, that 
is, the seat of consciousness. Beings having a spontaneous birth are generally 
invisible to the physical eye. Conditioned by their past Kamma, they appear 
spontaneously, without passing through an embryonic stage. Petas and Devas 
normally, and Brahmas belong to this class.</p>

<p>Some of those who have spontaneous birth in the <i>kāma</i>-sphere are 
asexual. But all beings who are Spontaneously born in the <i>rūpa</i>-sphere are 
not only asexual but are also devoid of sensitive nose, tongue, and body, though 
they possess those physical organs. The sensitive material qualities <i>
(pasādarūpas) </i>of those particular organs are lost as they are not of any 
practical use to Brahmas. </p>

<p>Egg-born beings are also included among womb-born beings. At the moment of 
conception they all obtain the three decads of body, sex, and the seat of 
consciousness. At times some are devoid of both masculinity and femininity. From 
this it is seen that even eggs are constituted with a consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>59. <b>Nibbāna</b>, Sanskrit Nirvāna, is composed of <i>ni</i> and <i>vāna.</i>
<i>Ni + vāna </i>= Nivāna = Nibāna = Nibbāna. <i>Ni</i> is a particle implying 
negation. <i>Vāna</i> means weaving or craving. It is this craving which acts as 
a cord to connect the series of lives of any particular individual in the course 
of his wanderings in Samsāra.</p>

<p>As long as one is entangled by craving or attachment, one accumulates fresh 
Karmic forces which must materialize in one form or other in the eternal cycle 
of birth and death. When all forms of craving are extirpated, Karmic forces 
cease to operate, and one, in conventional terms, attains Nibbāna, escaping the 
cycle of birth and death. The Buddhist conception of Deliverance is this escape 
from the ever-recurring cycle of birth and death, and is not merely an escape 
from &#39;sin and hell&#39;. </p>

<p>Etymologically, Nibbāna, derived from <i>ni + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
vu,</i> to weave, means non-craving or non-attachment , or &#39;departure from 
craving&#39;. Strictly speaking, Nibbāna is that Dhamma which is gained by the 
complete destruction of all forms of craving. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is also derived from <i>ni + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
vā,</i> to blow. In that case Nibbāna means the blowing out, the extinction, or 
the annihilation of the flames of lust, hatred, and ignorance. It should be 
understood that the mere destruction of passions is not Nibbāna <i>(khayamattam 
eva na nibbānanti vattabbam). </i>It is only the means to gain Nibbāna, and is 
not an end in itself. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is an ultimate reality <i>(vatthu-dhamma)</i> which is supramundane <i>
(lokuttara), </i>that is, beyond the world of mind and body or the five 
&#39;aggregates&#39;. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is to be understood by intuitive knowledge and inferential knowledge <i>
(paccakkha or pativedha ñāna and anumāna or anubodha ñāna). </i>To express both 
ideas it is stated that Nibbāna is to be realized by means of the wisdom 
pertaining to the four Paths of Sainthood and that it becomes an object to the 
Paths and Fruits. </p>

<p>Intrinsically <i>(sabhāvato)</i> Nibbāna is peaceful (santi). As such it is 
unique <i>(kevala).</i> This single Nibbāna is viewed as twofold according to 
the way it is experienced before and after death. The text uses a simple but 
recondite Pāli phrase - <i>kāranapariyāyena.</i> The Ceylon Commentary explains 
the cause for naming it as such with respect to its having or not having the 
aggregates as the remainder <i>(sa-upādisesādivasena paññāpane kāranabhūtassa 
upādisesābhāvābhāvassa lesena).</i> Adding a note on this term S. Z. Aung 
writes: &quot;The Ceylon Commentaries explain it by <i>paññāpane kāranassa lesena</i> 
- by way of device of the means (of knowing) in the matter of language.&quot; - 
Compendium, p. 168, n. 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Saupādisesa</b> - <i>Sa</i> = with; <i>upadi</i> = aggregates (mind and 
body); <i>sesa</i> = remaining. <i>Upādi</i>, derived from<i> upa + ā + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> dā,</i> to take, means the five aggregates as they are firmly grasped 
by craving and false views. It also signifies passions <i>(kilesas). </i>
According to the text and the Commentarial interpretations, Nibbāna, experienced 
by Sotāpannas, Sakadāgāmis, and Anāgāmis, is <i>saupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i> as 
they have the body and some passions still remaining. Nibbāna of the Arahats is 
also <i>saupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i>
as they have the body still remaining. It is only the Nibbāna of the Arahats 
after their death that is termed <i>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</i> because the 
aggregates and the passions are discarded by them. </p>

<p>Itivuttaka refers to these two kinds of Nibbāna, but mention is made only of 
Nibbāna comprehended by Arahats. It states: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>60. <b>Suññata</b> - Devoid of lust, hatred, and ignorance or of all 
conditioned things. Void here does not mean that Nibbāna is &#39;nothingness&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>61. <b>Animitta</b> - Free from the signs of lust, etc., or from the signs of 
all conditioned things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>62. <b>Appanihita</b> - Free from the hankerings of lust, etc., or because it 
is not longed for with any feelings of craving. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>63. <b>Padam</b> - Here the term is used in the sense of an objective reality <i>
(vatthu-dhamma).</i> &#39;State&#39; does not exactly convey the meaning of the Pāli 
term. It may be argued whether Nibbāna could strictly be called either a state 
or a process. In Pāli it is designated as a &#39;Dhamma&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>64. <b>Asankhata</b> - Nibbāna is the only Dhamma which is not conditioned by 
any cause. Hence it is eternal and is neither a cause nor an effect. </p>

<p>Introductory verse</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. The seventy-two kinds of entities (1) have (already) been described with 
their characteristics. Now I shall speak of their categories in accordance with 
their relations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 2. The compendium of categories should be understood as fourfold: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The compendium of immoral categories. </p>
  <p>The compendium of mixed categories</p>
  <p>The compendium of categories that pertain to enlightenment. </p>
  <p>The miscellaneous compendium. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial"><b></p>

<p>(Immoral Categories)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>(i) To begin with, in the immoral compendium there are four Defilements (2): </p>

<p>1. Sense-desires, 2. Attachment to existence, 3. False Views, and 4. 
Ignorance. </p>

<p>(ii) There are four Floods (3): (same as 1-4). </p>

<p>(iii) There are four Bonds (4): (same as 1-4). </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(iv) There are four (bodily) Ties (5): 1. Covetousness, 2. Ill will, 3. 
	Adherence to rites and ceremonies, 4. Dogmatic belief that &#39;this alone is 
	truth&#39;. </p>
    <p>(v) There are four Graspings (6): 1. Sense-desires, 2. False views, 3. 
	Adherence to rites and ceremonies, 4. Soul-theory (7). </p>
    <p>(vi) There are six Hindrances (8): 1. to Sense-desires, 2- Ill will, 3. 
	Sloth and Torpor, 4. Restlessness and Brooding, 5. Doubts, 6. Ignorance. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(vii) There are seven Latent Dispositions (9):</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Attachment to sensual pleasures, 2. Attachment to existence, 3. 
	Hatred, 4. Pride, 5. False Views, 6. Doubts, and 7. Ignorance. </p>
    <p>(viii) There are ten Fetters according to the Suttas (10): 1. Attachment 
	to sensual pleasures, 2. Attachment to Realms of Form, 3. Attachment to 
	Formless Realms, 4. Hatred, 5. Pride, 6. False Views, 7. Adherence to rites 
	and ceremonies, 8. Doubts, 9. Restlessness, and 10. Ignorance. </p>
    <p>(ix) There are ten other Fetters according to Abhidhamma: 1. Attachment 
	to sensual pleasures, 2. Attachment to existence, 3. Hatred, 4. Pride, 5. 
	False Views, 6. Adherence to rites and ceremonies, 7. Doubts, 8. Envy, 9. 
	Avarice, and 10. Ignorance. </p>
    <p>(x) There are ten Impurities (11): 1. Greed, 2. Hate, 3. Delusion, 4. 
	Pride, 5. False Views, 6. Doubts, 7. Sloth, 8. Restlessness, 9. Moral 
	Shamelessness, and 10. Moral Fearlessness (unscrupulousness). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Herein in the category of Defilements and so on the terms &#39;attachment to 
sensual pleasures&#39; and &#39;attachment to existence&#39; imply craving based on them. In 
the same way &#39;adherence to rites and ceremonies&#39;, dogmatic belief that &#39;this 
alone is truth&#39;, and &#39;clinging to the soul-theory&#39; connote just &#39;false views&#39; 
connected therewith. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually Defilements, Floods, Bonds, and Ties are threefold. There are two 
Graspings and eight Hindrances. Latent Dispositions are six. Fetters should be 
understood as nine. Impurities are ten. This compendium of immoral categories 
(12) is ninefold. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Vatthudhammā</b> - namely, 72. (1+52 +18 +1=72)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a. 1 - All the 89 types of consciousness are regarded as one as they 
		all possess the characteristic of &#39;awareness&#39;. </p>
        <p>b. 52 - All mental states <i>(cetasikas)</i> are viewed separately as 
		they possess different characteristics. </p>
        <p>c. 18 - All the conditioned <i>(nipphanna) rūpas</i> are considered 
		separately since they differ in their characteristics. </p>
        <p>d. 1 - Nibbāna is one inasmuch as it possesses the characteristic of 
		peacefulness. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>All these 72 are subjective and objective realities described in the previous 
chapters. They are miscellaneously treated in this chapter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>āsava</b> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
su,</i> to flow. They are so called either because they flow up to the topmost 
plane of existence or because they persist as far as the <i>gotrabhū</i> 
consciousness (i.e., the thought-moment that immediately precedes the 
Path-consciousness of the &#39;Stream-winner&#39; - sotāpatti). These <i>āsavas</i> are 
latent in all worldlings and may rise to the surface in any plane of existence. 
They lie dormant in all from an indefinite period and are treated as strong 
intoxicants or drugs that infatuate beings. Defilements, Corruptions, 
Depravities, Taints, Intoxicants, Stains, are suggested as the closest 
equivalents for this &#39;infamously famous&#39; Pāli term. See Compendium p. 170, n. 1; 
p. 227. </p>

<p>Of the four <i>āsavas, kāmāsava</i> means attachment to sensual pleasures, <i>
bhavāsava</i> is attachment to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> planes of existence, <i>
ditthāsava</i> are the sixty-two kinds of erroneous views, (see Digha Nikāya 1) 
and <i>avijjāsava</i> is ignorance with regard to the four Noble Truths, past 
life, future life, both past and future lives, and the Law of Dependent Arising. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Ogha</b> is derived from <i>ava + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
han, </i>to harm or kill. Beings caught in the current of a great flood are 
overturned and swept away directly to the sea and are hurled into the bottom. In 
the same way these <i>oghas</i>
drown beings completely and sweep them away into states of misery. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Yoga</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>yuj,</i>
to yoke. <i>Yogas</i> are those that yoke beings to the round of existence or to 
the machine of existence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Ganthas</b> are those that bind mind with body or the present body with 
bodies of future existences. Here the term kāya is used in the sense of mass or 
body both mental and physical. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Upādānāni</b> is derived from <i>upa + ā <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
dā,</i> to give. Intense craving is implied by the term. Hence in the <i>
paticcasamuppāda</i>
it is stated: Because of craving <i>(tanhā)</i> there is attachment or grasping <i>
(upādāna).</i>
<i>Tanhā</i> is like a thief groping in the dark to steal some thing. Upādāna is 
like the actual stealing. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Attavādūpādāna</b> - Commentaries mention twenty kinds of soul-theories 
associated with the five Aggregates as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(i) Soul is identical with the body,</p>
        <p>(ii) Soul is possessed of a body,</p>
        <p>(iii) Soul is in the body,</p>
        <p>(iv) Body is in the soul. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Four soul-theories connected with each of the remaining four Aggregates 
should be similarly understood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Nīvaranāni</b> - is derived from <i>nī + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
var,</i> to obstruct, to hinder. They are so called because they obstruct the 
way to celestial and Nibbānic bliss. According to the commentary this term means 
that which prevents the arising of good thoughts in the way of <i>jhānas,</i> 
etc., or that which does not allow the <i>jhānas</i> to arise, or that which 
obstructs the eye of wisdom. See A Manual of Buddhism, pp. 113-115, and The 
Buddha and His Teachings, pp. 539-542. </p>

<p>Usually <i>nīvaranas</i> are regarded as five, excluding ignorance. </p>

<p>Both sloth and torpor, restlessness and brooding, are grouped together 
because their functions <i>(kicca),</i> causes <i>(āhāra = hetu),</i> and their 
opposing factors are similar. The function of sloth and torpor is mental 
inactivity; that of restlessness and brooding is disquietude. The cause of the 
first pair is laziness; that of the second pair is vexation about the loss of 
relatives, etc. Energy is opposed to the first pair; tranquillity, to the second 
pair. </p>

<p>Sense-desire is compared to water mixed with various colours; ill will, to 
boiling water; sloth and torpor, to water covered with moss; restlessness and 
brooding, to perturbed water caused by wind; indecision, to turbid and muddy 
water. </p>

<p>Just as one cannot perceive one&#39;s own reflection in muddy water, even so when 
one is obsessed by Hindrances one cannot perceive what is conducive to the good 
and happiness of oneself and others. </p>

<p>These Hindrances are temporarily inhibited by the jhānas. They are completely 
eradicated by attaining, the four stages of Sainthood. Doubt or indecision is 
eradicated by attaining <i>sotāpatti;</i> sense-desire, ill will and brooding, 
by attaining Anāgāmi; sloth, torpor, and restlessness by Arahatta. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Anusaya,</b> derived from <i>anu + si, </i>to lie, to sleep, are those 
that lie dormant in oneself until an opportune moment arises for them to come to 
the surface as they have not been eradicated. All passions are <i>anusayas;</i> 
but these seven are the strongest. Every worldling who has reached the topmost <i>
jhāna</i> plane, when born amongst mankind, may give vent to these evil 
tendencies as they are latent in him. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Samyojana</b> - from <i>sam + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> yuj,</i>
to yoke, to bind, are those which bind beings to the round of existence. By 
means of the four Paths <i>(magga)</i> they are eradicated by degrees. See Ch. 
1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Kilesas</b> are those which defile or torment the mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. In the categories of evil the term <i>kāma</i> is at times applied to <i>
kāma</i>-sphere, and <i>bhava</i> to both <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> spheres. <i>
Lobha</i>
is implied by both <i>kāma-tanhā</i> and <i>bhava-tanhā.</i> Attachment to <i>
rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i>-spheres is <i>bhava-tanhā</i>. The three terms - <i>
sīlabbataparāmāsa</i>
(indulgence in rites and ceremonies), <i>idamsaccābhinivesa</i> (the dogmatic 
belief that this alone is truth) and <i>attavādūpādāna</i> (soul-theory) - 
connote <i>ditthi</i>
(false view, or error). Both <i>kāmāsava</i> and <i>bhavāsava</i> connote <i>
lobha.</i>
Strictly speaking, there are only three <i>āsavas, oghas, yogas,</i> and <i>
ganthas.</i>
Similarly there are only two <i>upādānas</i> by way of <i>lobha</i> and <i>
ditthi.</i> </p>

<p>When the two pairs - <i>thīna-middha</i> and <i>uddhacca-kukkucca</i>
- are treated as four mental states, <i>nīvaranas</i> amount to eight. When <i>
kāmarāga</i>
and <i>bhavarāga</i> are grouped in craving, <i>anusayas</i> amount to six. The 
ten <i>samyojanas</i>, according to Suttanta, are reduced to seven when <i>
kāmarāga, rūparāga, arūparāga</i>
are included in <i>lobha,</i> and <i>ditthi</i> and <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa</i> in <i>
ditthi.</i>
The ten <i>samyojanas</i> are treated as eight when <i>kāmarāga</i> and <i>
bhavarāga</i>
are included in <i>lobha,</i> and <i>ditthi</i> and <i>sīlabbataparāmāsa</i> in <i>
ditthi. Kilesas</i> are precisely ten. Thus, it will be seen, that the 14 
immoral mental states appear in different proportions in the nine categories of 
evil. <i>Lobha</i> is common to all. </p>

<p>§ 3. In the compendium of mixed categories (13): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) There are six Roots (14): 1. Greed, 2. Aversion, 3. Delusion, 4. 
  Non-attachment, 5. Goodwill, and 6. Wisdom. </p>
  <p>(ii) There are seven constituents of <i>jhāna</i> (15): 1. Initial

  Pleasure, 6. Displeasure, and 7. Equanimity or Indifference. </p>
  <p>(iii) There are twelve constituents of the Path (16): 1. Right

  Livelihood, 6. Right Effort, 7. Right Mindfulness, 8. Right Concentration, 9. 
  Wrong Views, 10. Wrong Thoughts, 11. Wrong Effort, 12. Wrong one-pointedness. </p>
  <p>(iv) There are twenty-two Faculties (17): 1. Eye, 2. Ear, 3. Nose, 4. 
  Tongue, 5. Body, 6. Femininity, 7. Masculinity, 8. Vitality, 9. Mind, 10. 
  Happiness, 11. Pain, 12. Pleasure, 13. Displeasure, 14. Equanimity, 15. 
  Confidence, 16. Effort, 17. Mindfulness, 18. Concentration, 19. Wisdom, 20. 
  The thought: &#39;I will realize the unknown&#39;, 21. Highest Realization, 22. The 
  Faculty of him who has fully realized. </p>
  <p>(v) There are nine Powers (18): 1. Confidence, 2. Energy, 3. Mindfulness, 
  4. Concentration, 5. Wisdom, 6. Moral shame, 7. Moral dread, 8. Moral 
  Shamelessness, 9. Moral Fearlessness. </p>
  <p>(vi) There are four Dominating Factors (19): 1. Intention (or Wish-to-do), 
  2. Energy (or Effort), 3. Mind (or Thought) (20), and 4. Reason (or 
  Intellect). </p>
  <p>(vii) There are four kinds of Food (21): 1. Edible Food, 2. Contact (or 
  sense-impact), 3. Volitional activities, and 4. (Rebirth) Consciousness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, amongst the Faculties, the thought, &#39;I will realize the unknown&#39; means 
the knowledge of the Path of the Stream-Winner <i>(Sotāpanna).</i> The Faculty 
of him who has fully realized, means the knowledge of the Fruit of Arahatship. 
Highest Realization means the intermediate six kinds of knowledge. The 
controlling Faculty of vitality is twofold, physical and mental. </p>

<p>The <i>jhāna</i> constituents (22) are not obtained in the five kinds of 
sense-cognition; &#39;Forces&#39;, in effortless states (23); &#39;the Path Constituents&#39;, 
in the Rootless(24). Similarly in the consciousness accompanied by Doubts (25), 
one-pointedness does not attain to the state of a &#39;Path Constituent&#39;, 
&#39;Controlling Faculty&#39; or a &#39;Force&#39;. Only one &#39;Dominating Power&#39; (26) is obtained 
at a time, according to circumstances, and only in the <i>javana</i> 
consciousness, accompanied by two or three moral roots. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In reality six roots, five <i>jhāna</i> constituents, nine Path constituents, 
sixteen controlling factors, nine powers have been described (27). </p>

<p>Likewise four dominant factors, and four kinds of food have been told. Thus 
in seven ways has the compendium of mixed categories, consisting of moral and 
immoral states, been enumerated. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Missakasangaho</b> - This is so called because moral <i>(kusala),</i>
immoral <i>(akusala),</i> and indeterminate <i>(avyākata),</i> are mixed in this 
section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Hetu</b> - See Chapter 1, p. <a HREF="#hetu">*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Jhānanga</b> - <i>Jhāna</i> is explained as that which burns up the 
opposing conditions of Hindrances, or that which closely perceives the object. 
Both these meanings are applicable to the ecstasies, gained by mental 
concentration. The six constituents of <i>jhāna</i> are used in these two 
senses. When the same factors appear in a moral or immoral consciousness and 
&#39;displeasure&#39; appears in an immoral consciousness, they are termed <i>jhānangas</i> 
in the second general sense. Only displeasure is immoral; the rest are moral, 
immoral, and indeterminate. See Chapter 1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Maggangāni</b> - Here <i>magga</i> is used in its general sense 
namely, that which leads to the presence of blissful states, woeful states, and 
Nibbāna <i>(sugati-duggatīnam nibbānassa ca abhimukham pāpanato maggā </i>- 
Comm.). Of the twelve constituents the last four lead to woeful states; the 
rest, to the blissful states and Nibbāna.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, by these twelve constituents are meant nine mental states 
found in different types of consciousness. Of the four evil constituents, wrong 
views mean the immoral <i>ditthi cetasikā;</i> wrong thoughts, wrong effort, and 
wrong one-pointedness mean the <i>vitakka, vāyāma,</i> and <i>ekaggatā cetasikās</i>
respectively found in the immoral types of consciousness. </p>

<p>Right Understanding means the <i>paññā cetasika;</i> right thoughts, right 
effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness mean the <i>vitakka, 
vāyāma, sati</i> and <i>ekaggatā cetasikas</i> respectively, found in the moral 
and indeterminate types of consciousness. Right speech, right action, and right 
livelihood are the three Abstinences <i>(virati) </i>found collectively in the 
supramundane consciousness and separately in mundane moral types of 
consciousness. The first eight are collectively found only in the eight types of 
supramundane consciousness. By the noble Eightfold Path are meant these eight 
specific mental states. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Indriya</b> - So called because they possess a controlling power in 
their respective spheres. The first five are the sensitive organs described 
earlier. The sixth and seventh are collectively called <i>bhāvindriya.</i> 
Vitality is both physical and mental. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 represent five 
kinds of feeling. 15,16,17,18, and 19 are treated both as Faculties and Powers 
as they influence their co-adjuncts and as they overcome their opposing forces. 
The last three Faculties are very important and they pertain to the 
supramundane. By <i>anaññātam</i> is meant the Nibbāna never seen before. It is 
at the first stage of Sainthood <i>(sotāpatti)</i> that the four Truths are 
realized for the first time. Hence the knowledge of the <i>sotāpatti</i> Path is 
technically called <i>anaññātam ñassāmi&#39;t&#39;</i> <i>indriyam</i>. The intermediate 
six kinds of knowledge from the <i>sotāpatti</i> Fruit to the Arahatta Path are 
termed <i>aññā</i>
(derived from <i>ā</i> = perfect + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i> to 
know), highest knowledge. As the wisdom found in all these seven types of 
supramundane consciousness controls the coexisting 37 Factors of Enlightenment, 
it is termed <i>indriya.</i>
An Arahat is called an <i>aññātāvī</i> because he has fully realized the four 
Noble Truths. The last Faculty refers to the highest knowledge of the Arahat in 
the Fruit stage.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Balāni</b> - These nine Powers are so called because they cannot be 
shaken by the opposing forces and because they strengthen their co-adjuncts. The 
first seven are moral; the last two, immoral. The first seven, in order, are 
opposed to faithlessness, laziness, heedlessness, restlessness, ignorance, moral 
shamelessness, and moral fearlessness. The last two immoral Powers are found 
only in the immoral twelve types of consciousness and they consolidate their 
co-adjuncts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>Adhipati,</b> lit., supremacy, or lordship therein. The difference 
between <i>adhipati</i> and <i>indriya</i> should be clearly understood. <i>
Adhipati</i>
may be compared to a king who, as the sole head of the State, lords over all his 
ministers. <i>Indriyas</i> are compared to the king&#39;s ministers who control only 
their respective departments without interfering with the others. The Faculty of 
eye, for instance, controls only its coexisting <i>rūpas</i> without any 
interference with the controlling faculty of the ear. In the case of <i>
adhipati,</i> one dominates all the other coexisting factors with no resistance 
from any. No two <i>adhipatis</i> can exercise supreme authority simultaneously. <i>
Indriyas</i> can have their compeers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. Here <i>citta</i> refers to the <i>javana</i> thought-process and <i>
vimamsā</i>
to the faculty of wisdom <i>(paññindriya). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>āhāra,</b> in this connection, is used in the sense of sustenance. 
Edible food <i>(kabalīkārāhāra)</i> sustains the material body. <i>Phassāhāra</i>
or contact or sense-impact sustains the five kinds of feeling. By <i>
manosamcetanāhāra</i>
are meant the different kinds of volitions present in the 29 types of moral and 
immoral mundane consciousness. They sustain or produce rebirth in the three 
spheres. <i>Viññānāhāra</i>
signifies the rebirth-consciousness that sustains the mental states and material 
phenomena
<i>(nāma-rūpa)</i> which arise simultaneously. There are 19 such types of 
rebirth-consciousness. In the case of Mindless Spheres they sustain only <i>
rūpa;</i> in the case of Formless Spheres they sustain only nāma. In the 
existences where the five Aggregates are present they sustain both mind and 
matter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. No <i>jhāna</i> constituents are present in the 10 types of 
sense-cognitions because the sense-impressions are weak, and close perception of 
the object is absent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. Effortless states are the sixteen types of consciousness, namely, ten 
sense-cognitions, two <i>sampaticchanas</i>, three <i>santīranas</i>, and the 
sense-door consciousness <i>(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i> One-pointedness present in 
them is not very strong. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. The Rootless are the 18 <i>ahetuka-cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. The one pointedness present in the <i>vicikicchā-citta</i> serves only to 
stabilize the mind. It is not powerful. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. There are no <i>adhipatis</i> in the <i>ahetuka</i> and <i>ekahetuka 
cittas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. Strictly speaking, there are five <i>jhāna</i> constituents because the 
three kinds of feeling could be treated as one; path constituents are nine, 
since wrong thoughts, effort, and one-pointedness are included in <i>vitakka, 
viriya</i>
and <i>ekaggatā</i> respectively. <i>Indriyas</i> are sixteen when the five 
kinds of feelings are grouped in one, and the three supramundane in <i>paññā. </i></p>

<p>Factors of Enlightenment (28)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. In the compendium of Factors pertaining to Enlightenment:- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. There are four Foundations of Mindfulness (29): 1. Mindfulness as 
  regards body, 2. Mindfulness as regards feelings, 3. Mindfulness as regards 
  thoughts, 4. Mindfulness as regards Dhamma. </p>
  <p>ii. There are four Supreme Efforts (30): 1. The effort to discard evils 
  that have arisen, 2. The effort to prevent the arising of unrisen evils, 3. 
  The effort to develop unrisen good, 4. The effort to augment arisen good. </p>
  <p>iii. There are four Means of Accomplishment (31): 1. Will, 2. Effort, 3. 
  Thought, 4. Reason. </p>
  <p>iv. There are five Faculties (32): 1. Confidence, 2. Effort, 3. 
  Mindfulness, 4. Concentration, 5. Wisdom. </p>
  <p>v. There are five Powers (32): 1. Confidence, 2. Effort, 3. Mindfulness, 4. 
  Concentration. 6. Wisdom. </p>
  <p>vi. There are seven Constituents of Enlightenment (33): 1. Mindfulness, 2. 
  Investigation of the Truth, 3. Effort, 4 Rapture, 5. Quietude, 6. 
  Concentration, 7. Equanimity. </p>
  <p>vii. There are eight Path Constituents (34): 1 Right Understanding, 2. 
  Right Thoughts, 3. Right Speech, 4. Right Action, 5. Right Livelihood., 6. 
  Right Effort, 7. Right Mindfulness, 8. Right Concentration. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here by the four Foundations of Mindfulness, Right Mindfulness alone is 
implied. Right Effort is implied by the four Supreme Efforts. </p>

<p>The sevenfold compendium which consists of 37 factors, is composed of these 
fourteen according to their nature: Will, Thought, Equanimity, Confidence, 
Quietude, Rapture, Right Understanding, Aspirations or Thoughts, Effort, the 
three Abstinences, Right Mindfulness, and Concentration. </p>

<p>The enumeration of these 37 sublime factors is as follows: Aspirations, 
Quietude, Rapture, Equanimity, Will, Thought, the three Abstinences, occur once; 
Effort nine times; Mindfulness eight times; Concentration four times; Wisdom 
five times; Confidence twice (35). </p>

<p>All these, save at times Aspirations and Rapture, occur in the Supramundane 
(Consciousness) and in the mundane (consciousness) too, according to 
circumstances, in the course of sixfold purity. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Bodhipakkhiya</b> - Bodhi means Enlightenment or the aspirant for 
Enlightenment. <i>Pakkhiya,</i> literally, means &#39;on the side of&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Satipatthāna</b> - <i>sati</i> = mindfulness, awareness, or 
attentiveness; <i>patthāna</i> = establishment, application, foundations, bases. 
These <i>satipatthānas</i>
are intended to develop both concentration and insight. Each <i>satipatthāna</i> 
serves a specific purpose. Contemplation on these four leads, on the one hand, 
to the development of &#39;undesirableness&#39; <i>(asubha),</i> painfulness <i>
(dukkha),</i> impermanence <i>(anicca),</i>
and &#39;soullessness&#39; <i>(anattā); </i>and, on the other hand, to the eradication 
of &#39;desirableness&#39;, pleasure, permanence and substantiality. </p>

<p>Briefly, the objects of mindfulness may be divided into <i>nāma</i>
and <i>rūpa.</i> The first - which deals with <i>rūpa,</i> breath is also 
regarded as a kind of <i>rūpa.</i> The second and the third deal with different 
kinds of feelings and thoughts. The fourth deals with both <i>nāma</i> and <i>
rūpa.</i> Hence it is very difficult to render the Pāli term, Dhamma, used in 
this connection, by one English equivalent. It is preferable to retain the Pāli 
term to avoid any misunderstanding. </p>

<p>For details see the Satipatthāna Sutta and the commentary. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Sammappadhāna</b> (Right exertion) - One mental state - <i>viriya</i>
- performs four functions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Iddhipāda</b> - The means of accomplishing one&#39;s own end or purpose. 
Strictly speaking, all these four pertain to the Supramundane Consciousness. <i>
Chanda</i>
is the mental state &#39;wish-to-do&#39;. <i>Viriya</i> refers to the four Supreme 
Efforts. <i>Citta</i>
means the Supramundane Consciousness. <i>Vīmamsā</i> signifies the mental state 
of wisdom present in the Supramundane Consciousness. Only when these four are 
present in the Supramundane Consciousness are they termed <i>iddhipāda.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Indriyas</b> and <b>Balas</b> are identical though different meanings 
are attached to them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Sambojjhanga</b> - <i>Sam</i> = exalted, good; <i>bodhi</i> = 
enlightenment or one who is striving for enlightenment; <i>anga</i> = factor. 
Here <i>dhammavicaya</i>
means seeing mind and matter as they truly are. It is insight. By <i>passaddhi</i> 
are meant both <i>citta-passaddhi</i> and <i>kāya-passaddhi</i> mental states. <i>
Upekkhā</i>
does not mean hedonic indifference but mental equipoise known as <i>
tatramajjhattatā.</i>
<i>Dhammavicaya, viriya,</i> and <i>pīti</i> are opposed to <i>thīna-middha</i> 
(sloth and torpor); <i>passaddhi, samādhi,</i> and <i>upekkhā,</i> to <i>
uddhacca</i>
(restlessness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Maggangāni</b> - According to the commentaries, here <i>magga</i>
is used in two different senses, namely, &#39;that which is sought by those who 
strive for Nibbāna&#39;, or &#39;that which goes by killing the passions&#39; <i>
(nibbānatthikehi maggīyatī&#39;ti vā kilese mārento gacchatī&#39; ti maggo). </i>
Evidently this particular definition has been given to differentiate the noble 
Eightfold Path from an ordinary one. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, these eight factors connote eight mental states 
collectively found in the supramundane consciousness that has Nibbāna for its 
object.</p>

<p><b>Sammā-ditthi</b> is rendered by Right Understanding, Right Views, Right 
Beliefs, Right Knowledge. <i>Sammā-ditthi</i> is explained as the knowledge of 
the four Noble Truths. In other words, it is the understanding of one&#39;s 
personality as it really, is or of things as they truly are. According to 
Abhidhamma, it is the mental state of wisdom <i>(paññā)</i> that tends to 
eradicate ignorance <i>(avijjā).</i> It is placed first because all actions 
should be regulated by wisdom. Right Understanding leads to Right Thoughts. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-sankappa</b> is rendered by Thoughts, Aspirations, Intentions, 
Ideas. According to Abhidhamma it is the mental state of <i>vitakka</i>
(application) that directs the mind to Nibbāna, eliminating the evil thoughts of 
sense-desires <i>(kāma),</i> ill will <i>(vyāpāda)</i> and cruelty <i>(himsā), </i>
by cultivating the good thoughts of renunciation <i>(nekkhamma),</i> 
loving-kindness <i>(avyāpāda),</i>
and harmlessness <i>(avihimsā).</i> </p>

<p>The first two constituents are grouped in wisdom <i>(paññā). </i></p>

<p>Right Thoughts lead to Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood. 
These three constitute <i>sīla</i> or Morality. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-vācā</b> signifies abstinence from lying, slandering, harsh speech, 
and frivolous talk. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-kammanta</b> deals with abstinence from killing, stealing, and 
misconduct. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-jīva</b> is twofold. It deals with right livelihood of both Bhikkhus 
and laymen. The latter are prohibited from trading in arms, slaves, intoxicants, 
animals for slaughter, and poison. </p>

<p>The three mental states of &#39;Abstinences&#39; <i>(virati)</i> are implied by these 
three constituents. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-vāyāma</b> signifies the four Supreme Efforts mentioned above. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-sati</b> denotes the four kinds of Mindfulness mentioned above. </p>

<p><b>Sammā-samādhi</b> is concentration or the &#39;one pointedness of the mind&#39;. 
It is the mental state of <i>&#39;ekaggatā&#39;. </i></p>

<p>The last three are included in <i>samādhi</i> or concentration. </p>

<p>The eight constituents comprise Morality, Concentration, and Wisdom or 
Insight. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. Effort <i>(viriya)</i> occurs nine times as follows: </p>

<p>4 Supreme Efforts, 1 Means of Accomplishment, 1 Controlling Factor, 1 Power, 
1 Constituent of Enlightenment, 1 Right Effort. </p>

<p>Mindfulness <i>(sati)</i> occurs eight times as follows: </p>

<p>4 Foundations of Mindfulness, 1 Controlling Factor; 1 Power, 1 Constituent of 
Enlightenment, 1 Right Mindfulness. </p>

<p>Concentration <i>(samādhi)</i> occurs four times as follows: </p>

<p>1 Controlling Factor, 1 Power, 1 Constituent of Enlightenment, and 1 Right 
Mindfulness. </p>

<p>Wisdom <i>(paññā) </i>occurs five times as follows: </p>

<p>1 Means of Accomplishment, 1 Controlling Factor 1 Power, 1 Constituent of 
Enlightenment, and 1 Right Understanding. </p>

<p>Confidence <i>(saddhā)</i> occurs twice as follows: </p>

<p>1 Controlling Factor, 1 Power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Supramundane Consciousness based on the second <i>jhāna</i>
is gained, there is no <i>vitakka.</i> When it is gained based on the fourth and 
fifth <i>jhānas,</i>
there is no <i>pīti. </i></p>

<p>These 37 factors are collectively found only in the Supramundane 
Consciousness, but in the mundane separately according to the type of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Herein sixty-nine entities comprising 52 mental states, 16 subtle matter, and 
Nibbāna, are regarded as the sphere of cognizables and the cognizable element. 
Only the sphere of mind divides itself into seven consciousness-elements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matter, feeling, perception, remaining mental states, and consciousness - 
these five are called the five Aggregates. </p>

<p>Similarly those that pertain to the three planes are regarded as Five 
Aggregates of grasping. </p>

<p>As Nibbāna lacks differentiation (such as past, present, future) it is 
excluded from the category of Aggregates. </p>

<p>Owing to the difference between doors and objects there arise (twelve) 
sense-spheres. In accordance with doors, objects, and their resultant 
consciousness arise the elements. </p>

<p>Existence in the three planes is suffering. Craving is its cause. Cessation 
is Nibbāna. Path is regarded as supramundane. </p>

<p>Mental states associated with the Paths and the Fruits are excluded from the 
four Truths. </p>

<p>Thus the category of &#39;the whole&#39; has been explained in five ways. </p>

<p>This is the seventh chapter of the Compendium of Abhidhamma dealing with the 
Abhidhamma Categories. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. Category of all such as Aggregates, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Khandha</b> means group, mass, aggregate. The Buddha analyses the 
so-called being into five groups. All the past, present, and future material 
phenomena are collectively called <i>rūpakkhandha.</i> The other four divisions 
should be similarly understood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. Here the term <b>Sankhāra</b> is used in a specific sense. Of the 52 
mental states, feeling is one, and perception is another. The remaining 50 
mental states are collectively called <i>sankhāra.</i> Mental formations, 
propensities, tendencies, syntheses, do not exactly convey the meaning of the 
Pāli term. Even &#39;volitional activities&#39; is not very appropriate. </p>

<p>&#39;Mental states&#39; is too general, but is not misleading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Upādānakkhandha.</b> They are so called because they form the objects 
of clinging or grasping. The eight supramundane states of consciousness and 
mental states found therein, and the ten material qualities not born of Kamma. 
are not treated as
<i>upādānakkhandha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>āyatana</b> means a field, sphere, basis. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41.<b>Cakkhāyatana</b> means the sensitive part of the eye which responds to 
visual stimuli. The four remaining sense-organs should be similarly understood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <b>Manāyatana</b> - There is no special organ for the mind like the 
physical organs. By mind-sphere is meant the &#39;adverting consciousness&#39; <i>
(manodvārāvajjana)</i>
together with the preceding &#39;arrest <i>bhavanga&#39;</i> <i>(bhavangupaccheda).</i> 
See Chapter 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. <b>Dhātu</b> is that which bears its own characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. <b>Dhamma-dhātu</b> is synonymous with <i>dhammāyatana</i> but differs 
from <i>dhammārammana</i> as it does not include <i>citta</i> (consciousness), <i>
paññatti</i>
(concepts), and <i>pasāda-rūpas</i> (sensitive material phenomena). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. <b>Manoviññānadhātu</b> - Of the 89 classes of consciousness 76 types of 
consciousness are regarded as mind-consciousness, excluding the tenfold 
sense-consciousness <i>(dvipañcaviññāna)</i> and the three <i>manodhātu</i> (= 
two types of receiving-consciousness and sense-door consciousness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. <b>Ariyasacca</b> - The Pāli term for truth is <i>sacca</i> which means 
that which is. Its Sanskrit equivalent is <i>satya</i> which denotes an 
incontrovertible fact. The Buddha enunciates four such truths which are 
associated with so-called beings. They are called <i>ariyasaccānī</i> because 
they were discovered by the Greatest Ariya, the Buddha, who was far removed from 
passions . </p>

<p>The first truth deals with <i>dukkha</i> which, for need of a better English 
equivalent, is inappropriately rendered by suffering or sorrow. As a feeling <i>
dukkha</i>
means that which is difficult to endure. As an abstract truth <i>dukkha</i> is 
used in the sense of contemptible <i>(du) </i>emptiness <i>(kha). </i>The world 
rests on suffering - hence it is contemptible. It is devoid of any reality - 
hence it is empty or void. <i>Dukkha,</i>
therefore, means contemptible void. </p>

<p>The cause of this suffering is craving or attachment <i>(tanhā)</i>
which leads to repeated births. The third Noble Truth is Nibbāna which can be 
achieved in this life itself by the total eradication of all forms of craving. 
The fourth Truth is the Noble Eightfold Path or the Middle Way. </p>

<p>The Compendium of Relations</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial"><b></p>

<p>Introductory verse</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. I shall now explain here, in a fitting manner, how causal states act as 
relations to the conditioned states (1). </p>

<p>§ 2. The compendium of relations is twofold: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A. The Law of Dependent Arising (2), and </p>

<p>B. The Law of Causal Relations (3). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of these, the Law of Dependent Arising is marked by the simple happening of a 
state dependent on its antecedent state (4). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Law of Causal Relations is said with reference to the existence of 
conditions that relate to one another. </p>

<p>Teachers explain them by mixing both methods. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font FACE="Arial"><b></p>

<p>The Law of Dependent Arising</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therein: </p>

<p>Dependent on Ignorance (5 ) arise Conditioning Activities (6). </p>

<p>Dependent on Conditioning Activities arises (Rebirth) Consciousness (7). </p>

<p>Dependent on (Rebirth) Consciousness arise Mind and Matter (8). </p>

<p>Dependent on Mind and Matter arise the six (Sense) Bases (9).</p>

<p>Dependent on the six (sense) Bases arises contact (10).</p>

<p>Dependent on Contact arises Feeling (11). </p>

<p>Dependent on Feeling arises Craving (12). </p>

<p>Dependent on Craving arises Grasping (13). </p>

<p>Dependent on Grasping arises Action or Becoming (14)</p>

<p>Dependent on Action arises Birth (15). </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dependent on Birth arise Decay, Death, Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief, 
	and Despair. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus arises the whole mass of suffering. </p>

<p>Herein this is the Law of the Dependent Arising. </p>

<p>It should be understood that there are three periods twelve factors, twenty 
modes, three connections, four divisions, three rounds, and two roots. </p>

<p>How ? </p>

<p>Ignorance and Conditioning Activities belong to the past; Birth, Decay, Death 
belong to the future; the intermediate eight to the present. Thus there are 
three periods. </p>

<p>Ignorance, (moral and immoral) Activities, (Rebirth) Consciousness, Mind and 
Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, Feeling, Craving, Grasping, Action, Birth, 
Decay and Death are the twelve factors. The terms Sorrow and so on are shown as 
incidental consequences (of Birth). </p>

<p>Here, by taking ignorance and activities, craving, grasping, and action are 
also taken. Likewise, by taking craving, grasping, and action, ignorance and 
activities are also taken. By taking birth, decay and death, the five effects 
with consciousness and so on are taken also. Thus there are: </p>

<p>Five causes pertaining to the past, and five effects to the present; five 
causes pertaining to the present, and five effects to the future. </p>

<p>There are twenty, modes, three connections and four divisions. </p>

<p>The three Rounds: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Ignorance, craving, and grasping belong to the Round of Passions; </p>
        <p>2. One part of becoming <i>(bhava)</i> known as action and (moral and 
		immoral) activities belongs to the Round of Kamma. </p>
        <p>3. One part of becoming known as renewed existence <i>(upapattibhava)</i>
        and the rest belong to the Round of Effects. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignorance and craving should be understood as the two roots (10) (see 
diagrams XVI and XVII).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the destruction of these roots does the Round cease. </p>

<p>The ignorance, originating from defilements (17), increases in the constantly 
oppressed who faint by decay and death. </p>

<p>The Great Sage has thus expounded this entangled, beginningless existence in 
the triple sphere as the &#39;Law of Dependent Arising&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Sankhatadhammānam</b> - To the conditioned <i>nāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i>
described in the previous chapters. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Paticcasamuppāda</b> - <i>Paticca</i> = because of, on account of; <i>
samuppāda</i> = arising, origination. Although the literal meaning of the term 
is &#39;arising because of&#39; or dependent arising or origination, it is applied to 
the whole causal formula which consists of twelve interdependent causes and 
effects, technically called <i>paccaya</i> and <i>paccayuppanna. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    </i><p>S. Z. Aung renders <i>paticcasamuppādanaya</i> by &#39;The Law of 
	  happening by way of cause&#39;. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In this chapter the Law of Dependent Arising is not mixed up with the 
Patthānanaya as in the Visuddhi-Magga. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Patthānanaya</b> - According to the Ceylon Commentary here the prefix <i>
&#39;pa&#39;</i> means &#39;various&#39; <i>(nānappakāra).</i> Ledi Sayadaw says &#39;principal&#39; <i>
(padhāna). Thāna</i> (lit. station) signifies &#39;cause&#39; <i>(paccaya)</i> which is 
paraphrased by <i>&#39;upakārakadhamma&#39;</i>
- aiding or supportive conditions. These various or principal causes are 
described in detail in the Patthānapakarana, the seventh book of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. The system expounded in this treatise is called Patthānanaya. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The difference between the two understood as follows: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Because of A arises B. Because of B arises C. When there is no A 
		there is no B. When there is no B there is no C. In other words &#39;this 
		being so, that is; this not being so, that is not&#39; <i>(imasmim sati, 
		idam hoti; imasmim asati, idam na hoti).</i>
        This is the <i>paticcasamuppādanaya</i>. </p>
        <p>ii. When we say that A is related to B in the way of &#39;coexistence&#39;, 
		&#39;interdependence&#39;, we get an illustration of <i>patthānanaya.</i> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Tabbhāvabhāvībhāvākāramatta;</b> <i>bhāvākāramatta</i> = the simple 
happening of a state; <i>tabbhāvabhāvī</i> = dependent on its antecedent state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Avijjā,</b> lit., not-knowingness, i.e., of the four Noble Truths. It 
is also explained as &#39;that which causes beings to run in the endless Samsāra&#39; <i>
(antavirahite samsāre satte javāpeti).</i> &#39;Whereby the fruit is produced&#39; is 
termed <i>&#39;paccaya&#39;,</i>
which is the cause. When ignorance is destroyed and turned into knowingness, all 
causality is shattered as in the case of Buddhas and Arahats. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Sankhāra</b> - This is a multisignificant term which should be 
understood according to the context. Here the term signifies immoral <i>
(akusala), </i>moral
<i>(kusala),</i> and unshakable <i>(āneñjā)</i> volitions <i>(cetanā)</i> which 
constitute Kamma that produces rebirth. The first embraces all volitions in the 
12 types of immoral consciousness; the second, all volitions in the 8 types of 
Beautiful <i>(kusala)</i>
consciousness and the 5 types of <i>kusala rūpa-jhāna</i> consciousness; the 
third, all volitions in the 4 types of <i>kusala arūpa-jhānas.</i> Where is no 
proper English equivalent which gives the exact connotation of this Pāli term. <i>
Sankhārā,</i> as one of the five aggregates, implies the 50 mental states 
excluding feeling and perception. </p>

<p>The volitions of the four supramundane Path consciousnesses <i>
(lokuttara-magga-citta)</i>
are not regarded as <i>sankhārā</i> because they tend to eradicate ignorance. 
Wisdom <i>(paññā)</i>
is predominant in Supramundane types of consciousness, while volition <i>
(cetanā)</i> is predominant in the mundane types of consciousness. </p>

<p>Ignorance is predominant in immoral activities, while it is latent in moral 
activities. Hence both moral and immoral actions are regarded as caused by 
ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Viññāna</b> - strictly denotes the 19 types of rebirth-consciousness <i>
(patisandhi viññāna)</i> described in chapter V. All the 32 types of resultant 
consciousness<i> (vipāka-citta)</i> experienced during lifetime, are also 
implied by the term. </p>

<p>The foetus in the mother&#39;s womb is formed by the combination of this 
relinking-consciousness with the sperm and ovum cells of the parents. In this 
consciousness are latent all the past impressions, characteristics and 
tendencies of that particular individual life-flux. </p>

<p>This relinking-consciousness is regarded as &quot;radiant&quot; <i>(pabhassara)</i>
as it is either devoid of immoral roots of lust, hatred and delusion (as in the 
case of rootless resultants - <i>ahetuka-vipāka),</i> or accompanied by moral 
roots (as in the case of resultants with roots).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Nāma-rūpa</b> - This compound should be understood as <i>nāma</i>
alone, <i>rūpa</i> alone, and <i>nāmarūpa</i> together. In the case of <i>arūpa</i>
planes there arises only mind; in the case of mindless <i>(asañña)</i> planes, 
only matter; in the case of <i>kāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i> planes, both mind and 
matter. </p>

<p>By <i>nāma</i> are here meant the three aggregates - feeling <i>(vedanā),</i>
perception <i>(saññā)</i> and <i>sankhārā</i> - that arise simultaneous with 
rebirth-consciousness. By <i>rūpa</i> are meant the three decads* <i>kāya,</i> <i>
bhāva-vatthu</i>
- that also arise simultaneous with rebirth-consciousness conditioned by past 
kamma. The second and third factors pertain to the past and present. The third 
and fourth factors, on the contrary, are contemporaneous. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>* The body decad <i>(kāyadasaka)</i> is composed of tbe four elements, 
namely, i. the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> ii. the element of 
cohesion <i>(āpo),</i>
iii. the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> iv. the element of motion <i>(vāyo);</i> 
its four derivatives <i>(upūdārūpa)</i> - namely, v. colour <i>(vanna),</i> vi. 
odour <i>(gandha),
</i>vii. taste <i>(rasa), </i>viii. nutritive essence <i>(oja),</i> with ix. 
vitality <i>(jīvitindriya),</i>
and x. body <i>(kāya).</i> </p>

<p>Sex-decad <i>(bhavadasaka)</i> and base-decad <i>(vatthudasaka) </i>also 
consist of the first nine and sex and seat of consciousness respectively. </p>

<p>From this it is evident that sex is determined by past Kamma at the very 
conception of the being. </p>

<p>Here <i>kāya</i> means the sensitive part of the body. Sex is not developed 
at the moment of conception but the potentiality is latent. Neither the heart 
nor the brain, the supposed seat of consciousness, is developed but the 
potentiality of the seat is latent.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Salāyatana</b> - During the embryonic period the six sense-bases 
gradually evolve from the psycho physical phenomena in which are latent infinite 
potentialities. The insignificant, infinitesimally small speck now develops into 
a complex six-sense-machine which now operates almost mechanically without any 
agent like a soul to act as the operator. The six sense-bases are eye, ear, 
nose, tongue, body, and mind. The first five refer to the sensitive organs that 
evolve by degrees. Mind-base has already been explained. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Phassa</b> - See Chapters 1 and 2. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Vedanā</b> - Ibid. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Tanhā</b> (Craving) is threefold, namely, craving for sensual 
pleasures <i>(kāma-tanhā),</i> craving for sensual pleasures associated with the 
view of eternalism <i>(bhava-tanhā)</i> i.e., enjoying, pleasures thinking that 
they are imperishable, and craving for sensual pleasures associated with the 
view of nihilism <i>(vibhava-tanhā)</i>
i.e., enjoying pleasures thinking that everything perishes after death. The last 
is the materialistic point of view. </p>

<p><i>Bhava-tanhā</i> and <i>vibhava-tanhā</i> are also interpreted as 
attachment to <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa</i> Planes respectively. Usually these 
two terms are rendered by craving for existence and non-existence. </p>

<p>There are six kinds of craving corresponding to the six sense-objects such as 
form, sound, and so on. They become 12 when they are treated as internal and 
external. They are reckoned as 36 when past, present and future are taken into 
consideration. When multiplied by the foregoing three kinds of craving they 
amount to 108.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Upādāna,</b> derived from <i>upa + ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
da,</i> to give, is intense craving or firm grasping. <i>Tanhā</i> is like 
groping in the dark to steal an object. <i>Upādāna</i> corresponds to the actual 
stealing. Grasping results with attachment and error. It gives rise to the false 
notions of &#39;I&#39; and &#39;mine&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Bhava,</b> lit., becoming, is explained as both moral and immoral 
action which constitute Kamma <i>(kamma-bhava)</i> - active process of becoming 
- and the different planes of existence <i>(upapattibhava)</i> - passive process 
of becoming. The only difference between <i>sankhāra</i> and <i>kammabhava</i> 
is that the former pertains to the past and the latter to the present. It is 
only the <i>(kamma) bhava
</i>that conditions the future birth. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Jāti,</b> strictly speaking, is the arising of the aggregates <i>
(khandhānam pātubhāvo).</i> Ignorance is shown as the past cause that conditions 
the present, and Craving as the present cause that conditions the future. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>āsavas</b> or Defilements, latent in all worldlings, are cited as the 
cause of ignorance. </p>

<p>24. Non-separation (38) &quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Herein this is the law of causal relations. </p>

<p>In six ways mind is related to mind. In five ways mind is related to mind and 
matter. Again mind is related in one way to matter, and matter in one way to 
mind. In two ways concepts, mind and matter are related to mind. In nine ways 
are the two - mind and matter - related to mind and matter. Thus the relations 
are sixfold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Relations of Mind and Matter</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. In six ways mind is related to mind: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consciousness and mental states that immediately cease, relate themselves to 
present consciousness and mental states by way of <b>contiguity</b>, <b>
immediacy</b>,
<b>absence</b> and <b>separation</b>. </p>

<p>Preceding Javanas are related to the subsequent, Javanas by way of <b>
repetition</b>
(or <b>habitual recurrence</b>). Coexisting consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another by way of <b>association</b>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. In five ways mind is related to mind and matter: </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Root, Jhāna</b> and <b>Path</b> factors are related to coexisting mind and 
matter by way of <b>root,</b> etc. </p>

<p>Coexisting volition is related to coexisting mind and matter and asynchronous 
volition to mind and matter born of Kamma by way of <b>Kamma</b>. </p>

<p>The (mental) aggregates of effect are related to one another and coexistent 
matter by way of <b>effect.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C. Only in one way is mind related to matter: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Subsequent consciousness and mental states are related to this preceding 
(material) body by way of <b>post-occurrence. </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>D. Only in one way is matter related to mind: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The six bases during life are related to the seven elements of cognition, and 
the five objects to the five processes of sense-cognition by way of <b>
antecedence.</b>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E. In two ways are concepts, mind and matter related to mind - namely, by 
  way of <b>object</b> and <b>powerful dependence. </b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therein object is sixfold as form, etc. But <b>powerful dependence</b>
is threefold - namely, powerful dependence as <b>object,</b> powerful dependence 
as <b>contiguity,</b>
and powerful dependence as <b>intrinsic nature.</b></p>

<p>Of them the object itself when it becomes prominent serves as a <b>powerful 
dependence</b> of the object. Consciousness and mental states that immediately 
cease, act as the <b>powerful dependence</b> <b>of proximity.</b> The <b>
powerful dependence of intrinsic nature</b> is of several kinds: states of lust, 
etc., states of confidence, etc., pleasure, pain, individual, food, season, 
lodging conditions, internal and external, as the case may be, are related to 
moral states, etc. Kamma, too, is similarly related to its effects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F. Mind and matter are related to mind and matter in nine ways according to 
  circumstances - namely, by way of <b>predominance, conascence, reciprocity, 
  dependence, nutriment, control, dissociation, presence,</b> and <b>non 
  separation.</b> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therein relation of <b>predominance</b> is twofold: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>i. The object to which weight is attached is related to states of mind by way 
of objective predominance. </p>

<p>ii. The fourfold coexisting predominance is related to coexisting mind and 
matter by way of conascence. </p>

<p>The relation of conascence is threefold: consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another and to the coexisting material states; the four Great 
Essentials mutually and to the derived material qualities; the heart-base and 
the resultant (mental aggregates) to one another at the moment of rebirth. </p>

<p>The relation of reciprocity is threefold: consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another; the four Great Essentials, to one another; the 
heart-base and the resultant mental aggregates to one another at the moment of 
rebirth. </p>

<p>The relation of dependence is threefold: consciousness and mental states are 
related to one another and coexisting matter; the four chief elements, to one 
another and derived material qualities; and six bases, to the seven cognitive 
elements. </p>

<p>The relation of nutriment is twofold: edible food is related to this body; 
and immaterial nutriment, to the coexisting mind and matter. </p>

<p>The relation of control is threefold: the five sensitive organs are related 
to the five kinds of cognition; the controlling power of material vitality, to 
the material qualities that have been grasped at; the immaterial controlling 
factors, to the coexistent mind and matter. </p>

<p>The law of dissociation is threefold: at the moment of conception the basis 
of mind is related to the effects (of kamma), and consciousness and mental 
states, to coexistent mind and matter by way of coexistence; the subsequent 
consciousness and mental states, to this antecedent body by way of 
post-occurrence; the six bases, in the course of life, to the seven cognitive 
elements by way of antecedence. </p>

<p>The five kinds of relations - coexistence, antecedence, post-occurrence, 
edible food, and material life - are, in every way, in the relation of presence 
and of non-separation. </p>

<p>All relations are included in the relations of object, powerful dependence, 
Kamma and presence. </p>

<p>Herein coexisting material qualities should be understood as twofold 
throughout the course of life they should be understood as those born of mind, 
and at rebirth as those born of kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus the relative conditions pertaining to the three periods of time and 
timeless, internal and external, conditioned and non-conditioned, are threefold 
by way of concept, mind and matter. </p>

<p>In all, the relations in Patthāna are twenty-four. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Hetu-paccaya</b> - Here <i>paccaya</i> presents some difficulty. It is 
defined as that by means of which an effect comes to be. In other words it is 
the cause. Furthermore, it is explained as a &#39;serviceable or supportive factor&#39; <i>
(upakārako dhammo).</i> <i>Hetu</i> is defined as &#39;that by which an effect is 
established&#39;. It is used in the sense of &#39;root&#39; <i>(mūlatthena).</i> Like the 
roots of a tree are hetu; like water and manure that aid its growth are <i>
paccaya.</i> In the Abhidhamma these two related terms are used in two different 
senses. In the Suttas, however, they are invariably employed as Synonymous 
terms, without any distinction, as, for example <i>ko hetu, ko paccayo</i> - 
what is the reason? what is the cause? </p>

<p>In the Patthāna 24 such <i>paccayas</i> are enumerated, and <i>hetu</i>
is one of them. <i>Hetu-paccaya</i> is explained as <i>&#39;hetu</i> itself is a <i>
paccaya&#39;</i>
or &#39;as <i>hetu</i> it becomes a <i>paccaya&#39;</i>. It is interpreted as a 
supportive or serviceable factor in the sense of root <i>(mūlatthena upakārako 
dhammo). </i>The causal relation by way of &#39;root&#39; may be suggested as the 
closest rendering. (See Compendium, p. 279; Journal of the Pāli Text Society, 
1915-1916, pp. 29-53.) </p>

<p>&#39;Roots are purely mental. They are the six moral and immoral roots. See 
Chapter 1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>ārammana</b> - or <b>ālambana</b>. The former is derived from <i>a + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> ram,</i> to delight in; the latter from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> 
lamb, </i>to hang upon. Things which the subject delights in or hangs upon are 
&#39;objects&#39;. There are six classes of objects. A form, for instance, acts as a 
causal relation to visual-consciousness by way of an &#39;object&#39;. It should be 
stated that there is nothing mundane or supramundane that does not become an 
object for mind. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Adhipati</b> - Lit., mastery or lordship over one&#39;s own. 0ne of the 
four dominant factors - namely, wish, thought, effort and reasoning - may, at 
one time, causally relate itself to coexistent mental states and material 
phenomena by way of predominance. &quot;Whenever such phenomena as consciousness and 
mental states arise by giving predominance to one of these four factors, then 
this phenomenon is to the other phenomenon a condition by way of predominance&quot;. 
(Patthāna)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>Anantara</b> and <b>Samanantara</b> - In meaning there is no 
difference between the two terms. They differ only in etymology. According to 
Buddhist philosophy one thought-moment perishes, immediately giving birth to 
another. The succeeding thought-moment inherits all the potentialities of its 
immediate predecessor. The perishing preceding states causally relate themselves 
to immediately following states by way of contiguity and immediacy. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. <b>Sahajāta</b> - The causal relation by way of conascence, as, for 
instance, the four mental aggregates, the different mental states that 
simultaneously arise in a particular type of consciousness, the four Great 
Essentials that arise together, the appearance of the three &#39;decads&#39; at the 
moment of conception, etc. In the <i>paticca</i>-<i>samuppāda</i>
it may be mentioned that both contact and feeling which appear as causes and 
effect are conascent. </p>

<p>A mental state may be conascent with a mental state, a mental with a 
physical, a physical with a physical, and a physical with a mental. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Aññamañña</b> - Just as the legs of a tripod are reciprocally helpful, 
even so mental or physical state or states may be causally related by way of 
reciprocity (or mutuality). Causal relations of conascence and reciprocity 
should be differentiated. They are not identical. For instance, mind-born 
material phenomena are not reciprocally related to the coexisting mind, nor are 
the material derivatives to the coexisting Great Essentials. As a rule, mind and 
matter are reciprocally related. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Nissaya</b> and <b>Upanissaya</b> - derived from <i>upa + ni + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> si,</i> to lie. <i>Upa</i> is an intensive prefix. As trees depend on 
the ground for their support, and as pictures depend on a canvas on which they 
are painted, so is the causal relation of dependence. <i>Upanissaya</i> is 
defined as a stronger form of Nissaya. It is compared to the rains on which 
depend the growth of trees. S. Z. Aung renders <i>upanissaya</i> by &#39;sufficing 
condition&#39;. For instance, one of the five heinous crimes such as matricide, 
parricide and so on, will serve as an <i>upanissaya</i>
to effect a birth in a woeful state. Good environments, early education, etc., 
will serve as a causal relation by way of &#39;dependence&#39; (nissaya) for the 
acquisition of health, wealth and knowledge in later life. Just as good actions 
become <i>upanissaya</i> for future good deeds, even so they may become <i>
upanissaya</i> for evil too as, for instance, spiritual pride. See Ledi 
Sayadaw&#39;s learned article on this subject in P.T.S. Journal, 1916, pp. 49-53. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Purejāta</b> - lit., born before or that which pre-exists. The six 
physical bases and six sensual objects are regarded as pre-existent. The 
pre-existent things are regarded as causal relations only when they continue to 
exist in the present and not by mere antecedence. Priority is not a good 
rendering. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Pacchājāta</b> - Of the 89 types of consciousness, 85 types, excluding 
the four <i>arūpa</i> resultants, and the 52 mental states, are causally related 
to the antecedent physical body by way of post-occurrence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>āsevana</b> - Repeated practice, as a rule, leads to proficiency. This 
applies to both good and evil things. By repetition one acquires a certain 
amount of skill in any particular thing. <i>āsevana</i> denotes this repeated 
practice. In <i>javana</i> process the second thought moment is causally related 
to the first, the third to the second, the fourth to the third, by way of 
recurrence. This is the reason why the fourth <i>javana</i> thought-moment is 
considered very powerful. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Kamma</b> means the volition that plays the most important part in 
moral and immoral thoughts, words, and deeds. This volition, technically known 
as Kamma, is causally related to the Kamma-born material phenomena, etc. As a 
seed to a tree so is Kamma causally related to its inevitable results. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Vipāka</b> - Like a cool breeze that pacifies a person seated under 
the cool shade of a tree, even so mental states of resultant types of 
consciousness are causally related to coexistent mental states and material 
phenomena by way of &#39;effect&#39; due to their effortless peaceful nature. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>āhāra</b> - Just as material food sustains the physical body, even so 
mental foods sustain mental states. Edible food is causally related to the body 
by way of nutriment or food; so are mental contacts or impressions <i>(phassa)</i> 
to feelings; volitions or moral and immoral actions <i>(mano-sañetanā)</i> to 
rebirth-consciousness <i>(patisandhi viññāna);</i> and rebirth-consciousness <i>
(viññāna)</i>
to mind and matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Indriya</b> - The controlling factors enumerated in Chapter VII become 
causally related to the coexistent mental states and material phenomena because 
they exercise control in their respective spheres. For instance, confidence 
controls its co-adjuncts in religious convictions; psychic and physical life, in 
vivifying mind and matter; mindfulness, in contemplative exercise; feelings, in 
grief and happiness, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Jhāna</b> - The seven <i>jhāna</i> factors of (1) initial application, 
(2) sustained application, (3) rapture, (4) happiness, (5) equanimity, (6) 
displeasure and (7) one-pointedness are causally related to one another and 
other concomitants by way of close perception and contemplation. For instance, 
the initial application <i>(vitakka)</i> is causally related to its concomitants 
in directing them towards the desired object. See Chapter 1. </p>

<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in two classes of consciousness rooted in attachment; 
1, 2, 6, 7, in hateful consciousness; 1, 2, 5, 7, in deluded consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Magga</b> - means a way or road. One way leads to woeful states; the 
other, to states of bliss. The vehicles that convey travelers to the former are 
the evil &#39;Path Constituents&#39; of wrong views, wrong application, wrong effort, 
and wrong one-pointedness. The vehicles that ply on the latter way are right 
understanding, right aspirations, right speech, right action, right livelihood, 
right effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness. These path factors 
are causally related to both mind and body, leading downwards in the case of bad 
ones, and leading away from existence (niyyāna) in the case of good ones. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Sampayutta</b> - Though possessing distinct characteristics from an 
ultimate standpoint yet, as certain mental states arise together, perish 
together, have one identical object and one identical base, they are causally 
related to one another by way of &#39;association&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. <b>Vippayutta</b> is the opposite of the foregoing. Sweet and bitter 
tastes may be helpful to each other in being dissimilar. For instance, mind that 
depends on the heart-basis is causally related to it by way of dissociation 
because, both mind and heart-basis are not mutually bound, as water on a lotus 
leaf. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Atthi</b> is the causal relation of states that exist in the present 
to similar states like the causal relation of coexistence. The visibility of 
objects, for instance, is due to the presence of light. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Natthi</b> - As with the disappearance of light, darkness spreads, so 
with the disappearance of the predecessor, the successor appears. Such is the 
causal relation by way of absence. For instance, the visual consciousness <i>
(dassana)</i>
is causally related to the immediately following receiving consciousness <i>
(sampaticchana)
</i>by way of absence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Vigata</b> and <b>Avigata</b> are similar to Natthi and Atthi 
respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. Therein the material states are just the aggregates of matter. </p>

<p>Consciousness and mental states, which comprise the four immaterial 
aggregates, and Nibbāna, are the five kinds that are immaterial. They are also 
called &#39;name&#39; <i>(nāma).</i> </p>

<p>The remaining <i>paññatti</i> (39) is twofold, inasmuch as it is made known, 
or as it </p>

<p>makes known.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>There are such terms as &#39;land&#39;, &#39;mountain&#39;, and the like, so designated on 
account of the mode of transition of the respective elements; such terms as 
&#39;house&#39;, &#39;chariot&#39;, &#39;cart&#39;, and the like, so named on account of the mode of 
formation of materials; such terms as &#39;person&#39; ,&#39;individual&#39;, and the like, so 
named on account of the five aggregates; such terms as &#39;direction&#39;, &#39;time&#39;, and 
the like, named according to the revolution of the moon and so forth; such terms 
as &#39;well&#39;, &#39;cave&#39;, and the like, so named on account of the mode of non-impact 
and so forth; such terms as Kasina-objects and the like, so named on account of 
respective elements and different mental culture. </p>

<p>All such different things, though they do not exist in an ultimate sense, 
become objects of thought in the form of shadows of (ultimate) things. </p>

<p>They are called <i>&#39;paññatti&#39;</i> because they are thought of, reckoned, 
understood, expressed, and made known on account of, in consideration of, with 
respect to, this or that mode. </p>

<p>This <i>&#39;paññatti&#39;</i> is so called because it is made known.</p>

<p>As it makes known it is called <i>&#39;paññatti&#39;</i>. it is described as &#39;name&#39;, 
&#39;name-made, etc. </p>

<p>It is sixfold (40): </p>

<p>1. A real concept, 2. an unreal concept, 3. an unreal concept by means of a 
real concept, 4. a real concept by means of an unreal concept, 5. a real concept 
by means of a real concept, 6. an unreal concept by means of an unreal concept. </p>

<p>As, for instance, when they make known by a term, such as &#39;matter&#39;, 
&#39;feeling&#39;, and so forth, that exist in reality, it is called a &#39;real concept&#39;. </p>

<p>When they make known by a term, such as &#39;land&#39;, &#39;mountain&#39; and so forth, that 
do not exist in reality, it is called an &#39;unreal concept&#39;. </p>

<p>The rest should respectively be understood by combining both as, for 
instance, &#39;possessor of sixfold supernormal vision&#39;, &#39;woman&#39;s voice&#39;, &#39;visual 
cognition&#39;, &#39;king&#39;s son&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By following the sound of speech through the process of auditory 
consciousness, and then by means of the concept conceived by mind-door that 
subsequently arises, are meanings understood. </p>

<p>These concepts should be understood as fashioned by world-convention. </p>

<p>This is the eighth chapter which deals with the Analysis of Causal Relations 
in the Compendium of Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Paññatti</b> - There are two kinds of <i>paññatti</i> or concepts - 
namely, <i>attha-paññatti</i> and <i>nāma-paññatti.</i> The former is made 
known, that is, the object conveyed by the concept. The latter is that which 
makes known, that is, the name given to the object. </p>

<p>Land, mountain, etc. are called <i>&#39;santhāna-paññatti&#39;</i>, formal concepts, 
since they correspond to the form of things. </p>

<p>Chariot, village, etc., are called <i>&#39;samūha-paññatti&#39;</i>, collective 
concepts, since they correspond to a collection or group of things. </p>

<p>East, west, etc., are called <i>&#39;disā-paññatti&#39;</i>, local concepts, since 
they correspond to locality. </p>

<p>Morning, noon, etc., are called <i>&#39;kāla-paññatti&#39;</i>, time concepts, since 
they correspond to time. </p>

<p>Well, cave, etc., are called <i>&#39;ākāsa-paññatti&#39;</i>, space-concepts, since 
they correspond to open space. </p>

<p>Visualized image, conceptualized image, etc. are called <i>&#39;nimitta-paññatti&#39;</i>, 
since they correspond to mental signs gained by mental development. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. Six kinds of <b>Paññatti</b> -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. Matter, feeling, etc., exist in an ultimate sense. </p>
  <p>2. Land, mountain, etc., are terms given to things that do not exist in an 
  ultimate sense. </p>
  <p>3. &#39;Possessor of sixfold supernormal vision.&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the former does not exist in an ultimate sense, but the latter does. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4. Woman&#39;s voice. Here the voice exists in an ultimate sense, but not the 
  woman. </p>
  <p>5. Eye-consciousness. Here the sensitive eye exists in an ultimate sense, 
  and so does the consciousness dependent on it. </p>
  <p>6. King&#39;s son. Here neither the son nor the king exists in an ultimate 
  sense. </p>

<h3>Compendium of Subjects for Mental Culture: (I)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introductory verse</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. Hereafter I will explain the twofold subject of mental culture which 
deals with Calm (2) and Insight (3). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Compendium of Calm)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 2. Of the two, in the Compendium of Calm, to with, the objects of mental 
culture are sevenfold: A. the ten Kasinas, B. the ten Impurities, C. The ten 
Reflections, D. the four Illimitables, E. the one Perception, F. the one 
Analysis, G. the four <i>arūpa-jhānas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The six kinds of temperaments (4): 1. the lustful, 2. the hateful, 3. the 
unintelligent, or ignorant, 4. the devout, or faithful, 5. the intellectual, or 
wise, 6. the discursive. </p>

<p>The three stages of Mental Culture: 1. the preliminary (5), 2 . the 
proximate, 3. the concentrative. </p>

<p>The three signs (6): 1. the preliminary, 2. the abstract, 3. the 
conceptualized. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How ? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. The ten kasinas (7) are; earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, 
  white, space, and light. </p>
  <p>B. The ten Impurities (8) are: a bloated (corpse), a discoloured (corpse), 
  a festering, (corpse), a dissected (corpse), an eaten (corpse), a 
  scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a mutilated and scattered-in-pieces (corpse), a 
  bloody (corpse), a worm-infested (corpse), and a skeleton. </p>
  <p>C. The ten Reflections (9) are: 1. The Reflection on the Buddha, 2. The 
  Reflection on the Doctrine, 3. The Reflection on the order, 4. The Reflection 
  on morality, 5. The Reflection on generosity, 6. The Reflection on deities, 7. 
  The Reflection on peace, 8. The Reflection on death, 9. Mindfulness regarding 
  the body, 10. Mindfulness regarding breathing (10). </p>
  <p>D. The four Illimitables, also called Sublime States, (11), are: 
  loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity. </p>
  <p>E. The one Perception is the feeling of loathsomeness about food (12). </p>
  <p>F. The one Analysis is the analysis of the four elements (13). </p>
  <p>G. The four <i>arūpa-jhānas</i> are the &#39;Infinity of Space&#39; (14) and so 
  forth. In the exposition of &#39;Calm&#39; there are altogether forty (15) subjects of 
  meditation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suitability of Subjects for different Temperaments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 3. With respect to temperaments the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness 
regarding the body&#39;, such as the 32 parts, are suitable for those of a lustful 
temperament (16). </p>

<p>The four &#39;Illimitables&#39; and the four colored <i>kasinas</i> are suitable for 
those of a hateful temperament (17). </p>

<p>The reflection on &#39;Breathing&#39; is suitable for those of an unintelligent and 
discursive temperament.</p>

<p>The six Reflections on the Buddha and so forth are suitable for those of a 
devout temperament; Reflection on &#39;Death&#39;, &#39;Peace&#39;, &#39;Perception&#39;, and 
&#39;Analysis&#39;, for those of an intellectual temperament, and all the remaining 
subjects of mental culture, for all. </p>

<p>Of the <i>kasinas</i> a wide one is suitable for the unintelligent, and a 
small one for the discursive.</p>

<p>Herein this is the section on suitability. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stages of Mental Culture</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 4. The preliminary stage of mental culture is attainable in all these 
forty; subjects of meditation. In the ten subjects of mental culture such as the 
eight Reflections on the Buddha and so forth and the one &#39;Perception&#39;, and the 
one &#39;Analysis&#39; (18) only proximate mental culture is attained but not the 
concentrative stage. In the thirty remaining subjects of mental culture the 
concentrative stage of mental culture is also attained. </p>

<p>Therein the ten <i>kasinas</i> and the &#39;Breathing&#39; produce five <i>jhānas;</i>
the ten &#39;Impurities&#39; and &#39;Mindfulness regarding the body&#39; only the first <i>
jhāna;</i>
the first three &#39;Illimitables&#39; such as loving-kindness, four <i>jhānas;</i> 
&#39;equanimity&#39; (19) the fifth <i>jhāna.</i></p>

<p>Thus these twenty-six subjects of mental culture produce <i>rūpa-jhānas.</i>
</p>

<p>The four &#39;formless&#39; objects produce the <i>arūpa-jhānas.</i></p>

<p>This is the section on mental culture. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Signs of Mental Culture</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 5. Of the three signs, the preliminary sign and the abstract sign are 
generally obtained in every case according to the object. But the conceptualized 
image is obtained in the <i>&#39;Kasinas&#39;</i>, &#39;Impurities&#39;, &#39;Parts of the body&#39;, 
and &#39;Breathing&#39;. </p>

<p>It is by means of the conceptualized image that the proximate on pointedness 
and the ecstatic one-pointedness are developed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How? </p>

<p>Whatever object amongst the earth kasinas and so forth, a beginner takes to 
practice meditation, is called a preliminary sign and that meditation is 
preliminary mental culture. When that sign is perceived by the mind and enters 
the mind-door as if seen by the very (physical) eye then it is called the 
abstract sign. That meditation becomes well established.</p>

<p>Likewise when a counter-image born of mediation, freed from original defects 
(20) reckoned as a concept, is well established and fixed in the mind of one who 
is well composed and who thereafter, practices meditation on the abstract sign 
by means of preliminary concentration then it is said that the conceptualized 
image has arisen. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rūpa Jhāna</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thereafter &#39;proximate concentration&#39;, free from obstacles, pertaining to the <i>
kāma</i>-Sphere, arises. Then he who develops the conceptualized image by means 
of &#39;proximate concentration&#39; attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> of the <i>rūpa</i>-Sphere.
</p>

<p>Thenceforth by bringing that very first <i>jhāna</i> under one&#39;s sway by 
means of these five kinds of mastery (21) - namely, reflection, attainment, 
resolution, emergence, and revision - the striving person, by inhibiting the 
coarse factors like &#39;initial application&#39; and so forth, and by developing the 
subtle factors like &#39;sustained application and so forth attains, by degrees, 
according to circumstances, to the second <i>jhāna</i>
and so forth. </p>

<p>Thus with respect to twenty-two subjects of mental culture such as the earth 
kasina, etc., the conceptualized image is obtained. But in the remaining 
(eighteen) subjects of mental culture the &#39;Illimitables&#39; relate to the concept 
of beings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arūpa Jhāna (22)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, to one who practices concentration on space abstracted from any <i>
kasina</i>
excluding the <i>ākāsa kasina,</i> thinking - &#39;this is infinite&#39; - there arises 
the first <i>arūpa</i> <i>jhāna.</i> To one who practices concentration on that 
very first <i>arūpa jhāna,</i> thinking that &#39;it is infinite&#39;, there arises the 
second <i>arūpa jhāna.</i>
To one who practices concentration on the non-existence of the first <i>arūpa</i>-consciousness, 
the thinking &#39;there is naught whatever&#39; - there arises the third <i>arūpa jhāna.</i> 
To him who practices concentration on the third <i>arūpa</i> consciousness, 
thinking &#39;it is calm, it is sublime&#39;, there arises the fourth <i>arūpa jhāna. </i></p>

<p>In the remaining ten subjects of mental culture when concentration is 
practiced on an object like the attributes of the Buddha and so forth and when 
the sign is well grasped &#39;preliminary meditation&#39; becomes steadfast therein and 
&#39;proximate meditation&#39; is also accomplished. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supernormal Knowledge (23)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emerging from the fifth jhāna (serving as a) basis for supernormal knowledge, 
and reflecting on the &#39;resolution&#39; and so forth, when one practices 
concentration on physical objects, etc., there arises according to 
circumstances, the fifth <i>rūpa-jhāna</i> induced in the way of developing 
supernormal knowledge. </p>

<p>The five kinds of supernormal knowledge are: Various Psychic Powers, 
Celestial Ear, Discerning other&#39; thoughts, Reminiscence of past births, and 
Celestial Eye.
</p>

<p>Herein this is the section mental culture. </p>

<p>The method of meditation on Calm is ended. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Kammatthāna</b> - Here this term is used in a technical sense. Kamma 
means the act of meditation or contemplation. <i>Thāna,</i> literally, station, 
ground, or occasion, implies subjects or exercises. <i>Kammatthāna,</i> 
therefore, means &#39;subjects of meditation&#39; or &#39;meditation exercises&#39;. There are 
forty such subjects of meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Samatha</b> derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sam,</i>
to lull, to subdue, denotes &#39;tranquillity&#39; &#39;quietude&#39;, gained by subduing the 
Hindrances. It is synonymous with concentration <i>(samādhi) </i>which leads to 
the development of <i>jhānas.</i>
By concentration passions are only temporarily inhibited. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Vipassanā,</b> derived from <i>vi + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
dis,</i> to see, literally means perceiving in diverse ways, that is in the 
light of transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness. It is rendered by 
&#39;insight&#39;, &#39;contemplation&#39;, &#39;intuition&#39;, &#39;introspection&#39;. The sole object see 
things as they truly are, in Emancipation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Carita</b> signifies the intrinsic nature of a person, which is 
revealed when one is in a normal state without being preoccupied with anything. 
The temperaments of people differ owing to the diversity of their actions or 
Kammas. Habitual actions tend to form particular temperaments. </p>

<p><i>Rāga</i> (lust) is predominant in some, while <i>dosa</i> (anger, hatred 
or ill will), in others. Most people belong to these two categories. There are a 
few others who lack intelligence and are more or less ignorant <i>(moha-carita).</i> 
Akin to the ignorant are those whose minds oscillate, unable to focus their 
attention deliberately on one thing <i>(vitakka-carita).</i> By nature some are 
exceptionally devout
<i>(saddhā-carita), </i>while others are exceptionally intelligent <i>
(buddhi-carita). </i></p>

<p>Thus, in brief, there are six kinds of temperaments.</p>

<p>By combining them with one another, we get 63 types. With the inclusion of <i>
ditthi-carita</i> (speculative temperament) there are 64. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. The preliminary stages of mental development are termed <i>
parikamma-bhāvanā</i>. Mental culture, from the moment one develops the 
conceptualized image and temporarily inhibits the Hindrances, until the <i>
gotrabhū</i> thought-moment in the <i>jhāna javana</i>
process, is termed <i>upacāra-bhāvanā</i>. </p>

<p>The thought-moment that immediately follows the <i>gotrabhū</i>
thought-moment is called <i>appanā,</i> ecstatic concentration, because vitakka 
(initial application), the foremost <i>jhāna</i> constituent, persists as if 
firmly fixed upon the object of concentration. </p>

<p><i>Jhāna</i> Thought-Process: <i>manodvārāvajjana / parikamma, upacāra, 
anuloma, gotrabhū, appanā / bhavanga.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Any object, such as a <i>kasina,</i> used for preliminary mental culture 
is termed <i>&#39;parikamma-nimitta&#39;. </i></p>

<p>The same object, when mentally perceived with closed eyes, is termed <i>
&#39;uggaha-nimitta&#39;.
</i></p>

<p>The identical visualized image, freed from all <i>kasina</i> defects, is 
termed <i>&#39;patibhāganimitta&#39;</i> when it serves as an object of <i>upacāra</i> 
and <i>appanā bhāvanā.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Kasina</b> means &#39;whole, &#39;all, &#39;complete&#39;. It is so called because the 
light issuing from the conceptualized image is extended everywhere without any 
limitation.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>pathavi-kasina</i> one makes a circle of about one span and 
four fingers in diameter and, covering it with dawn-coloured clay, smoothes it 
well. If there be not enough clay of dawn-coloured, he may put in some other 
kind of clay beneath. This prepared circle is known as <i>kasina-mandala</i> and 
is also called <i>parikamma-nimitta.</i>
Now he places this object two and half cubits away from him and concentrates on 
it, saying mentally or inaudibly - <i>pathavi, pathavi</i> or earth, earth. The 
purpose is to gain one-pointedness of mind. When he does this for some time, 
perhaps weeks, or months, or years, he will be able to close his eyes and 
visualize the object. This visualized object is called <i>&#39;uggaha-nimitta&#39;.</i> 
Then he concentrates on this visualized image until it develops into a 
conceptualized or counter-image free from original <i>kasina</i> faults. This is 
known as the &#39;patibhāganimitta&#39;. As he continually concentrates on this abstract 
concept he is said to be in possession of proximate or neighborhood 
concentration <i>(upacāra-samādhi).</i>
At this stage the innate five Hindrances are temporarily inhibited. Eventually 
he gains &#39;ecstatic concentration&#39; <i>(appanā samādhi). </i></p>

<p>For the water-<i>kasina</i> one may take a vessel full of colourless water, 
preferably rain water, and concentrate on it, saying - <i>āpo, āpo,</i> (water, 
water) until he gains one-pointedness of mind. </p>

<p>To develop the fire-<i>kasina</i> one may kindle a fire before him and 
concentrate on it through a hole, a span and four fingers in diameter, in a 
rush-mat, a piece of leather, or a piece of cloth, saying <i>tejo, tejo,</i> 
(fire, fire). </p>

<p>One who develops the air-<i>kasina</i> concentrates on the wind that enters 
through window space or a hole in the wall, saying, <i>vāyo, vāyo</i> (air, 
air).
</p>

<p>To develop the colour-<i>kasinas</i> one may take a <i>mandala</i> of the 
prescribed size, and colour it blue, yellow, red, or white and concentrate on 
it, repeating the name of the colour as in the case of the other <i>kasinas. </i></p>

<p>One may even concentrate on blue, yellow, red, or white flowers. </p>

<p>Light <i>kasina</i> may be developed by concentrating on the moon, or on an 
unflickering lamplight, or on a circle of light cast on the ground, or on the 
wall by sunlight or moonlight entering through a wall-crevice or hole, saying - <i>
āloka, āloka</i> (light, light). </p>

<p>Space-kasina can be developed by concentrating on a hole, a span and four 
fingers in diameter, in either a well-covered pavilion or a piece of leather, or 
a mat, saying, <i>okāsa, okāsa</i> (space, space). </p>

<p>It may be mentioned that light and space <i>kasinas</i> are not mentioned in 
the Texts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Asubha</b> - Those ten kinds of corpses were found in ancient Indian 
cemeteries and charnel places where dead bodies were not buried or cremated and 
where flesh-eating animals frequented. In modern days they are out of the 
question. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Anussati</b> - literally, means repeated reflection or constant 
mindfulness. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. <b>Buddhānussati</b> is the reflection on the virtues of the Buddha as, 
  for example: &quot;Such indeed is that Exalted One, Worthy, Fully Enlightened, 
  Endowed with Wisdom and Conduct, Well-farer, Knower of the Worlds, an 
  Incomparable Charioteer for the training of individuals, Teacher of gods and 
  men, Omniscient, and Holy&quot;.</p>
  <p>ii. <b>Dhammanussati</b> is reflection on the virtues of the Doctrine as, 
  for example: &quot;Well-expounded is the doctrine by the Exalted One, to be 
  realized by oneself, of immediate fruit, inviting investigation, leading to 
  Nibbāna, to be understood by the wise, each one for himself&quot;. </p>
  <p>iii. <b>Sanghānussati</b> is the reflection on the virtues of the pure 
  members of the Noble Celibate Order as follows: &quot;Of good conduct is the Order 
  of the disciples of the Exalted One; of upright conduct is the Order of the 
  disciples of the Exalted One; of wise conduct is the Order of the disciples of 
  the Exalted One; of dutiful conduct is the Order of the disciples of the 
  Exalted One. The four pairs of persons constitute eight individuals. This 
  Order of the disciples of the Exalted One is worthy of offerings, is worthy of 
  hospitality, is worthy of gifts, is worthy of reverential salutation, is an 
  incomparable field of merit for the world&quot;. </p>
  <p>iv. <b>Sīlānussati</b> is reflection on the one&#39;s own virtuous conduct.</p>
  <p>v. <b>Cāgānussati</b> is reflection on one&#39;s own charitable nature. </p>
  <p>vi. <b>Devatānussati</b> - &quot;Deities are born in such exalted states on 
  account of their faith and other virtues. I too possess them.&quot; Thus when one 
  reflects again and again on one&#39;s own faith and others&#39; virtues, placing 
  deities as witnesses, it is called Devatānussati.</p>
  <p>vii. <b>Upasamānussati</b> is reflection on the attributive qualities of 
  Nibbāna, such as the cessation of suffering, etc.</p>
  <p>viii. Maranānussati is reflection on the termination of psycho physical 
  life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Contemplation on death enables one to comprehend the fleeting nature of 
	life. When one understands that death is certain and life is uncertain one 
	endeavors to make the best use of one&#39;s life by working for self-development 
	and for the development of others, instead of wholly indulging in sensual 
	pleasures. Constant meditation on death does not make one pessimistic and 
	lethargic but, on the contrary, it makes one more active and energetic. 
	Besides one can face death with serenity. </p>
    <p>While contemplating death, one may think that life is like a flame, or 
	that all so-called beings are the outward temporary manifestations of the 
	invisible Karmic energy, just as an electric light is the outward 
	manifestation of the invisible electric energy. Choosing various similes, 
	one may meditate on the uncertainty of life and on the certainty of death. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>ix. Kāyagatāsati is reflection on the 32 impure parts of the body such as 
  hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, etc. This meditation on the 
  loathsomeness of the body, leads to dispassion. Many Bhikkhus in the time of 
  the Buddha attained Arahatship by meditating on these impurities. If one is 
  not conversant with all the thirty-two parts, one may meditate on one part 
  such as bones. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Within this body is found a skeleton. It is full of flesh which is 
	covered with a skin. Beauty is nothing but skin deep. When one reflects thus 
	on the impure parts of the body passionate attachment to this body gradually 
	disappears. </p>
    <p>This meditation may not appeal to those who are not sensual. They may 
	meditate on the innate creative possibilities of this complex machinery of 
	man. </p>
    <p>The thirty-two parts of the body are enumerated as follows: </p>
    <p>&quot;Hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinew, bones, marrow, 
	kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, bowels, mesentery, stomach, 
	faeces, brain, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, lymph, tears, grease, 
	saliva, nasal mucus, articular fluid, and urine&quot;. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>x. <b>ānāpānasati</b> is mindfulness on respiration. <i>āna</i>
  means inhalation and <i>apāna</i> exhalation. In some books these two terms 
  are explained in the reverse way. Concentration on the breathing process leads 
  to one-pointedness of the mind, and ultimately to Insight which leads to 
  Arahatship. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>10. This is one of the best subjects of meditation, which appeals equally to 
all. The Buddha also practiced <i>ānāpānasati</i> before His Enlightenment. </p>

<p>A detailed exposition of this meditation is found in the Satipatthāna Sutta 
and in the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p>A few practical hints are given here for the benefit of the average reader. </p>

<p>Adopting a convenient posture, breathe out and close the mouth. Then breathe 
in through the nostrils calmly, without strain. Inhale first and count mentally 
one. Exhale and count two, concentrating on the breathing process. In this 
manner count up to ten, constantly focusing your attention on respiration. It is 
possible for the mind to wander before one counts up to ten. But one need not be 
discouraged. Try again until success is achieved. Gradually one can increase the 
number of series, say five series of ten. Later one can concentrate on the 
breathing process without counting. Some prefer counting as it aids 
concentration; while others prefer not to count. What is essential is 
concentration, and not counting, which is secondary. When one does this 
concentration exercise one feels light in body and mind and very peaceful. One 
might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. When one practices this 
concentration for a certain period, a day may come when one will realize that 
his so-called body is supported by mere breath, and that the body perishes when 
breathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes impermanence. Where there is change 
there cannot be a permanent entity or an immortal soul. Insight might then be 
developed to gain Arahatship. </p>

<p>It is now clear that the object of this concentration on respiration is not 
merely to gain one-pointedness but also to cultivate Insight in order to obtain 
Deliverance. </p>

<p>This simple method may be pursued by all without any harm. </p>

<p>For more details readers are referred to the Visuddhi Magga. </p>

<p>In some Suttas this simple method of respiration is explained as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Attentively he breathes in, attentively he breathes out. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. When making a long inhalation he knows, &#39;I make a long inhalation; 
		when making a long exhalation, he knows, &#39;I make a long exhalation&#39;. </p>
        <p>2. When making a short inhalation he knows, &#39;I make a short 
		inhalation&#39;; when making a short exhalation he knows, &#39;I make a short 
		exhalation&#39;. </p>
        <p>3. &#39;Clearly perceiving the entire (breath) body <i>
		(sabbakāyapatisamvedi),</i>
        I will inhale&#39;: thus he trains himself; &#39;clearly perceiving the entire 
		(breath) body. I will exhale&#39;: thus he trains himself. </p>
        <p>4. &#39;Calming this breathing process <i>(passam bhayam kāyasankhāram),</i>
        I will inhale&#39; thus he trains himself; &#39;calming this breathing process, 
		I will exhale&#39;: thus he trains himself. </p>

<p>11. <b>Brahmavihāra</b> - Here Brahma means sublime, as in <i>brahmacariya</i>
(sublime life). <i>Vihāra</i> means mode or &#39;state of conduct&#39; or &#39;state of 
living&#39;. They are also termed <i>appamaññā</i> (limitless, boundless) because 
these thoughts are radiated towards all beings, without limit or obstruction. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. <b>Mettā</b> (Sanskrit: Maitri) loving-kindness, benevolence, goodwill - 
  is defined as that which softens one&#39;s heart. It is not carnal love or 
  personal affection. The direct enemy of Mettā is hatred, ill will or aversion <i>
  (kodha); </i>its indirect enemy is personal affection <i>(pema).</i> Mettā 
  embraces all beings without exception. The culmination of Mettā is the 
  identification of oneself with all beings <i>(sabbattatā).</i>
  It is the wish for the good and happiness of all. Benevolent attitude is its 
  chief characteristic. It discards ill will. </p>
  <p>ii. <b>Karunā</b> - compassion - is defined as that which makes the hearts 
  of the good quiver when others are subject to suffering, or that which 
  dissipates the sufferings of others. Its chief characteristic is the wish to 
  remove the sufferings of others. Its direct enemy is wickedness <i>(himsā) </i>
  and its indirect enemy is passionate grief <i>(domanassa)</i> Compassion 
  embraces sorrow-stricken beings, and it eliminates cruelty. </p>
  <p>iii. <b>Muditā</b> is not mere sympathy but sympathetic or appreciative 
  joy. Its direct enemy is jealousy, and its indirect enemy is exhilaration <i>
  (pahāsa).</i>
  Its chief characteristic is happy acquiescence in others&#39; prosperity and 
  success <i>(anumodanā).</i>
  Muditā embraces prosperous beings. It eliminates dislike <i>(arati) </i>and is 
  the congratulatory attitude of a person. </p>
  <p>iv. <b>Upekkhā</b> literally, means to view impartially, that is, with 
  neither attachment nor aversion. It is not hedonic indifference but perfect 
  equanimity or a well-balanced mind. It is the balanced state of mind amidst 
  all vicissitudes of life such as praise and blame, pain and happiness gain and 
  loss, repute and disrepute. Its direct enemy is attachment<i> (rāga)</i> and 
  its indirect enemy is callousness. Upekkhā discards clinging and aversion. 
  Impartial attitude is its chief characteristic. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Here Upekkhā does not mean mere neutral feeling, but implies a sterling 
	virtue. Equanimity, mental equilibrium, are its closest equivalents. Upekkhā 
	embraces the good and the bad, the loved and the unloved, the pleasant and 
	the unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>See Chapter 2, note 4. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>12. <b>āhāre patikkūlasaññā</b> - i.e., the feeling of loathsomeness of food, 
in its search, eating, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Catudhātuvavatthānam</b> - i.e., the investigation of the four primary 
elements of extension, cohesion, heat, and motion, with regard to their 
characteristics, etc. 14. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Arūpajhānas</b> - See Ch. 1. They are: (i) &#39;The Realm of the Infinity 
of Space&#39;, (ii) &#39;The Realm of the Infinity of Consciousness&#39;, (iii) &#39;The Realm 
of Nothingness&#39;, and (iv) The &#39;Realm of neither Perception nor Non-perception&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. Thirty-eight objects when &#39;light&#39; and &#39;space&#39; are excluded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. Because they tend to create a disgust for the body which fascinates the 
senses. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. Because the objects are deep and vast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. These objects are too coarse, and vitakka, one of the constituents of <i>
jhāna,</i> is an indispensable aid to practice concentration on them. As there 
is no <i>vitakka</i> in the remaining four <i>jhānas,</i> they cannot be 
developed by concentrating on these two objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. As equanimity <i>(upekkhā)</i> is found only in the fifth <i>jhāna,</i>
the first four <i>jhānas</i> cannot be developed by concentrating on this last 
&#39;Illimitable&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Vatthudhammato</b> - i.e., from the defects found in the original <i>
kasina-mandala. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>āvajjana</b> - reflection on the different constituents of <i>jhāna.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Samāpajjana</b> - the ability to attain to different <i>jhānas</i>
quickly. </p>

<p><b>Adhitthāna</b> - the ability to remain in the <i>jhānas</i> as long as one 
likes. </p>

<p><b>Vutthāna</b> - the ability to emerge from the <i>jhānas</i> as quickly as 
possible. </p>

<p><b>Paccavekkhana</b> is similar to āvajjana. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. See Ch. 1, p. <a HREF="#page58">*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Abhiññā</b> - Only one who has gained the fifth <i>jhāna</i>
can develop the following five kinds of supernormal knowledge or vision: </p>

<p>i. <b>Iddhividha</b> - Flying through the air, walking on water, diving into 
the earth, creation of forms, etc., belong to this category. </p>

<p>ii. <b>Dibbasota</b> is the Celestial Ear, also called clairaudience, which 
enables one to hear subtle or coarse sounds far or near. </p>

<p>iii. <b>Paracittavijānana</b> is the power to discern the thoughts of others. </p>

<p>iv. <b>Pubbenivāsānussati</b> is the power to remember the past lives of 
oneself and others. This is the first supernormal vision the Buddha developed 
during the first watch on the night. He attained Enlightenment. With regard to 
this knowledge the Buddha&#39;s power is limitless, while in the case of others it 
is limited. </p>

<p>v. <b>Dibbacakkhu</b> is the Celestial or Divine Eye, also called 
clairvoyance, which enables one to see heavenly or earthly things, far or near, 
which are imperceptible to the physical eye. This as the second knowledge the 
Buddha developed during the second watch on the night of His Enlightenment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cutūpapātañāna knowledge with regard to the dying and reappearing of 
beings, is identical with this Celestial Eye. <i>Anāgatamsañāna,</i>
knowledge with regard to the future, and <i>yathākammūpagañāna,</i> knowledge 
with regard to the faring of beings according to their own good and bad actions, 
are two other kinds of knowledge belonging to the same category. These come 
within the range of Buddha&#39;s Omniscience. </p>

<p>These five kinds of supernormal vision are worldly. To these should be added 
the sixth supernormal knowledge - <i>āsavakkhayañāna</i> - knowledge with regard 
to the extinction of passions which is supramundane. </p>

<p>The first five kinds may be developed at any period; but the last, only 
during a Buddha-cycle. </p>

<p>Different Kind of Purity</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 6. In the exercises on mental culture pertaining to Insight (24) the 
section on &#39;Purity&#39; is sevenfold: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Purity of Morals, </p>
    <p>2. Purity of Mind, </p>
    <p>3. Purity of views, </p>
    <p>4. Purity of Transcending Doubts, </p>
    <p>5. Purity of Vision in discerning the Path and Non-Path, </p>
    <p>6. Purity of Vision in discerning the method, </p>
    <p>7. Purity of Vision regarding intuitive wisdom. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three Characteristic Marks: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The Characteristic Mark of Impermanence (25), </p>
    <p>2. The Characteristic Mark of Suffering (26), and </p>
    <p>3. The Characteristic Mark of No-soul (27). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three Contemplations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The Contemplation on Impermanence, </p>
    <p>2. The Contemplation on Suffering, and </p>
    <p>3. The Contemplation on No soul. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are ten kinds of Insight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Investigating knowledge (28), </p>
    <p>2. Knowledge with regard to the arising and passing away (of conditioned 
	things), </p>
    <p>3. Knowledge with regard to the dissolution (of things), </p>
    <p>4. Knowledge (of dissolving things) as fearful, </p>
    <p>5. Knowledge of (fearful) things as baneful, </p>
    <p>6. Knowledge of (baneful) things as disgusting, </p>
    <p>7. Knowledge as regards the wish to escape from them, </p>
    <p>8. Knowledge of reflecting contemplation (9), </p>
    <p>9. Knowledge of equanimity towards conditioned things (30), and </p>
    <p>10. Knowledge of adaptation (31). </p>
    <p>There are three Emancipations (32): </p>
    <p>1. Emancipation through Void (33), </p>
    <p>2. Emancipation through Signlessness (34); and </p>
    <p>3. Emancipation through Desirelessness (3)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three Doors of Emancipation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Contemplation on the Void, </p>
    <p>2. Contemplation on the Signlessness, and </p>
    <p>3. Contemplation on Desirelessness. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>How?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Purity of Morals (36) consists of four kinds of perfect discipline, namely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Moral Discipline as regards the Fundamental Precepts, </p>
    <p>2. Discipline as regards sense-restraint, </p>
    <p>3. Discipline as regards purity of livelihood, </p>
    <p>4. Discipline as regards the four requisites. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Purity of Mind (37) consists of two kinds of concentration, namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. &#39;proximate concentration&#39;, and </p>
    <p>2. &#39;established or ecstatic concentration&#39;. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Purity of Views (38) is the understanding of mind and matter with respect to 
their characteristics, function, mode of appearance, and proximate cause. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Purity of Transcending Doubts (39) is the comprehension of the causes of 
those very mind and matter. </p>

<p>After comprehending the causes, the meditator, considering the methods of 
aggregates, etc., formulates in groups the conditioned things of the triple 
plane, that have arisen with causes, differing according to the past, etc., and 
that have been comprehended in the foregoing manner. Now he meditates on the 
three characteristics - impermanence in the sense of dissolution, suffering in 
the sense of fearfulness, and soullessness in the sense of unsubstantiality - by 
way of duration, continuity, and momentariness. To him who meditates on the 
arising and passing away of things by means of the knowledge so named with 
respect to causes and momentariness there arise - </p>

<p>an aura, joy, quietude, excessive faith, effort, happiness, wisdom, 
mindfulness equanimity and a liking (for that state). </p>

<p>Purity of Vision in discerning what is the Path and what is not the Path 
(40), is the determining of characteristics of Path and not Path by 
understanding an aura etc., as inimical impediments of insight. </p>

<p>Getting rid of these inimical impediments, the meditator reflects on the 
three Characteristics. Now to him, starting from the knowledge of arising and 
passing away, and extending up to the knowledge of adaptation, there arise in 
one continuous stream of contemplation, nine kinds of Insight. By Purity of 
Vision that discerns the method (41) is meant these nine kinds of knowledge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Realization</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When he thus practices contemplation, owing to the ripening of insight (he 
feels) &#39;Now the development (of the path) (42) will arise&#39;. Thereupon arresting 
the life-continuum, arises mind-door consciousness, followed by two or three 
(moments of) insight consciousness having for their object any of the 
Characteristics such as impermanence etc. They are termed &#39;preliminary&#39;, 
&#39;proximate&#39;, and &#39;adaptation&#39; (moments) (43). </p>

<p>That knowledge of equanimity towards conditioned things, together with 
knowledge that conforms (to the truths), when perfected, is also termed &#39;Insight 
of emergence leading to the Path (44). </p>

<p>There after the <i>gotrabhū</i>-consciousness (45), having Nibbāna as its 
object occurs, overcoming the lineage of the worldlings, and evolving the 
lineage of the Ariyas*. <a NAME="page414"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The thought-process of a Stream-Winner: manodvārāvajjana - parikamma - 
upacāra - anuloma - gotrabhū - magga - phala - phala - bhavanga.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immediately after that consciousness, the Path (of the Stream-Winner)*, 
realizing the Truth of suffering, eradicating the Truth of its cause, realizing 
the Truth of its cessation, and developing the Truth of the Way to its 
cessation, descends into the (supramundane) <i>appanā</i> thought-process. </p>

<p>After that Path-consciousness two or three moments of Fruit-consciousness 
arise and subside into the life-continuum (46). Then, arresting the 
life-continuum, the knowledge of reflection occurs. </p>

<p>The wise man reflects (47) on the Path, Fruit, Nibbāna, defilements 
destroyed, and either reflects or does not reflect on the remaining defilements. </p>

<p>Thus the fourfold Path which has to be developed by degrees by means of the 
sixfold purity is called the &#39;Purity of Intuitive Knowledge&#39; (48). </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Purity. </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Vipassanā</b> or Insight is the third and final stage on the Path of 
Sainthood. The chief object of Insight is to understand things as they truly 
are. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Anicca,</b> i.e., the fleeting nature of both mind and matter. 
Changeableness is a characteristic of everything that is conditioned. All 
conditioned things are constantly changing, not remaining static for two 
consecutive moments. Mind, in fact, changes even faster than matter. Normally 
matter endures only for seventeen thought-moments. Commentators state that, 
during the time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments 
may arise. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Dukkha</b> - All conditioned things are subject to suffering. Birth is 
suffering, decay is suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering. Union 
with the unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant is suffering. Not 
to get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates of 
attachment are suffering.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Anattā</b> - Or Soullessness is the crux of Buddhism. As there is no 
permanent entity in matter, so also there is no unchanging entity in mind 
conceived as an &#39;ego&#39; or soul&#39;. In everything mundane and supramundane 
conditioned and non-conditioned, there is no permanent soul. Hence the Buddha in 
the Dhammapada stated <i>&#39;sabbe dhammā anattā</i> - all dhammas are soulless&#39;. 
With regard to <i>anicca</i> and <i>dukkha</i>
the Buddha said <i>&#39;sankhārā</i> - conditioned things&#39;. With regard to <i>
anattā,</i>
the Buddha employed the term <i>dhammā</i> to include supramundane unconditioned 
Nibbāna as well. </p>

<p>It may be mentioned that it was after hearing the &#39;Anattalakkhana Sutta&#39;, the 
discourse on soullessness, that the first five monks attained Arahatship. </p>

<p>The aspirant does not usually meditate on all these three characteristics. Of 
them, he takes only that which appeals to him most. Deliverance, gained by 
meditating on one of them, is named accordingly. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Sammasanañana</b> - Lit., &#39;handling-knowledge&#39;, is the investigating 
of aggregates as composite <i>(kalāpavasena). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Patisankhāñāna</b> is the recontemplation of conditioned things in 
order to find out the means to escape the refrom. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</b> is perfect equanimity towards all conditioned 
things, having neither attachment nor aversion, resulting from developing the 
foregoing different kinds of Insight. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>31. <b>Anuloma-ñāna</b> is the &#39;adaptation knowledge&#39; gained by perfecting 
the foregoing nine kinds of Insight. It is so called because it conforms itself 
to 37 Factors of Enlightenment and qualifies the aspirant for the higher path. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Vimokkha</b> - so called because the deliver one from the ten Fetters, 
etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Suññata</b> - devoid of a soul. Emancipation gained by meditating on 
soullessness <i>(anattā) </i>is called <i>suññata-vimokkha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Animitta</b> - free from the signs of permanence, etc. Emancipation 
gained by meditating on &#39;impermanence&#39; <i>(anicca)</i> is called <i>
animitta-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. <b>Appanihita</b> - free from the hankering of craving. Emancipation 
gained by meditating on &#39;suffering&#39; <i>(dukkha) </i>is called <i>
appanihita-vimokkha.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Sīlavisuddhi</b> - Purity of Morals, is the first of seven &#39;Purities&#39;. 
It consists of four kinds, all pertaining to the life of a Bhikkhu.</p>

<p>The first is <i>pātimokkhasamvarasīla.</i> &#39;That which saves one who observes 
it from woeful states&#39; is the commentarial explanation of <i>&#39;pātimokkha&#39;.</i> <i>
Pā</i>
is also explained as the Buddhas Teaching. <i>Atipamokkha</i> means extremely 
important. <i>Pātimokkha</i>
therefore means &quot;Fundamental Teaching&quot; or &quot;Fundamental Precepts&quot;. It deals with 
220* disciplinary rules which every Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it 
restrains one from evil deeds, etc., it is termed <i>&#39;samvara&#39;.</i> Sīla is used 
in the sense of &#39;composure&#39; <i>(samādhāna) </i>and &#39;support&#39; <i>(upadhārana).</i> 
It is so called because it tends to discipline thoughts, words, and deeds, and 
because it acts as a support for other virtues. <i>Indrivasamvarasīla</i> the 
second <i>sīla,</i> deals with the control of the six senses. <i>
ājīvapārisuddhisīla,</i> the third <i>sīla,</i>
deals with the right livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the necessaries of 
life, a Bhikkhu should not act in an unbecoming way. <i>Paccayasannissitasīla</i> 
the fourth <i>sīla,</i>
is concerned with the unselfish use of the four requisites - robes, alms, 
lodging, and medicine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*227 including seven ways of settling disputes
(adhikarana samatha dhamma).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Cittavisuddhi</b> - is the second &#39;Purity. It is the purity of mind, 
gained by developing the <i>jhānas,</i> temporarily inhibiting the Hindrances. A 
purified mind is like a polished mirror where everything is reflected in its 
true perspective. With a purified mind one can see things as they truly are. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Ditthivisuddhi</b> - is the third &#39;Purity&#39;. It is so called because it 
purifies one from the false theory of a permanent soul. This correct 
comprehension results from investigating mind and matter as regards their 
salient characteristics <i>(lakkhana),</i> function or essential properties <i>
(rasa),</i> the way of manifestation <i>(paccupatthāna),</i> and their immediate 
cause <i>(padatthāna). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Kankhāvitaranavisuddhi</b> - is the fourth &#39;Purity&#39; which attempts to 
transcend skeptical doubts as regards cause and effect, the past, the present, 
and the future. This is called a purity because it removes the stain of 
erroneous views of &#39;chance&#39;, causelessness&#39;, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this purity one meditates on the various causes that tend to 
produce present mind and matter, and on the causes that sustain them in the 
present. He understands that present mind and matter at conception were 
conditioned by past ignorance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, during 
lifetime, matter is conditioned by kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and edible 
food, while mind is sustained by the senses and their corresponding objects. 
Thus he realizes the second noble truth of the cause of suffering and rids 
himself of doubts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40. <b>Maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi</b> - This is the fifth &#39;Purity&#39;. </p>

<p>The aspirant ho has cleared his doubts, meditates again with better 
understanding on the three characteristics of <i>anicca, dukkha,</i> and <i>
anattā.</i>
He realizes that life is a mere flowing, a continuous undivided movement. He 
finds no genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to 
pain. What is transient is painful, and where change and sorrow prevail there 
cannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising and passing away of conditioned 
things become very conspicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed in meditation he 
witnesses an aura <i>(obhāso)</i> emanating from his body as a result of his 
keen insight. He experiences also an unprecedented joy <i>(pīti),
</i>happiness <i>(sukha),</i> and quietude <i>(passaddhi).</i> He becomes 
strenuous <i>(paggaho)
</i>and even-minded <i>(upekkhā).</i> His religious fervour increases <i>
(adhimokkha),</i>
mindfulness <i>(sati) </i>strengthens, and wisdom <i>(ñāna)</i> ripens. Laboring 
under the misconception that he has attained Sainthood, chiefly owing to the 
presence of the aura, he yearns <i>(nikanti)</i> for this state of mind. Soon he 
realizes that these temptations are only impediments <i>(upakkilesa) </i>to 
Insight, and that he has not really attained Sainthood. Accordingly he 
endeavours to distinguish between the right and wrong path <i>
(maggāmaggañānadassana).</i> It is called a &#39;purity because it clears up the 
misconception as regards the actual &#39;path&#39;. He understands, &#39;This is the right 
path, that is the wrong path&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Patipadāñānadassanavisuddhi</b> - is the sixth &#39;Purity&#39;. This term is 
collectively applied to the nine kinds of Insight beginning with the knowledge 
as regards the arising and passing away of conditioned things, and ending with 
the knowledge of adaptation that occurs in the Path thought-moment immediately 
preceding the <i>gotrabhū</i>
moment. (See p. <a HREF="#page429">*</a>, footnote ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. <b>Appanā</b> - the supramundane Path <i>(lokuttara-magga). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43. See pp. <a HREF="#page218">218*</a>, <a HREF="#page414">414*</a>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. <b>Vutthānagāminīvipassanā</b> - is the name given to both <i>
sankhārupekkhā-ñāna</i>
and <i>anuloma-ñāna</i> of the ten kinds of Insight. It is so called because it 
leads to the Path emerging from woeful states and signs of conditioned things. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45. <b>Gotrabhū</b> - lit, means &#39;overcoming the worldly lineage&#39;. The object 
of this thought-moment is Nibbāna, but the actual realization of Nibbāna by the 
eradication of passions occurs at the Path thought-moment that immediately 
follows. This particular thought-moment in the three higher stages of Sainthood 
is termed <i>&#39;vodāna&#39;</i>
(pure) as the aspirant is already an Ariya. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46. Immediately after the <i>gotrabhū</i> thought-moment there arises the 
Path thought-moment of the Sotāpanna. It is at this stage that one comprehends 
the Truth of Suffering, eradicates craving, the cause of suffering, and actually 
realizes Nibbāna for the first time in his life. The eight factors that 
constitute the Noble Path are also fully developed at this stage. This 
particular thought-moment is termed <i>&#39;sotāpatti-magga&#39;.</i>
<i>Sota</i> here means the stream that leads to Nibbāna. It is the Noble 
Eightfold Path. <i>āpatti</i>
means &#39;entering for the first time&#39;. It is called <i>&#39;magga&#39;</i> because it 
arises, destroying the passions. This Path thought-moment arises only once in 
the course of one&#39;s lifetime, and is immediately followed by two or three 
&#39;Fruit&#39; <i>(phala)</i> moments before the stream of consciousness lapses into <i>
bhavanga.</i> This is the reason why the Dhamma is called <i>&#39;akālika&#39;</i> 
(immediately effective). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. <b>Paccavekkhanañānāni</b> - As a rule after each of the four stages of 
Sainthood one reflects on the Path and Fruit one has attained, on the Nibbāna 
one has realized, on the defilements one has destroyed, and in the case of the 
first three stages, on the defilements one has yet to destroy. An Arahat who has 
no more defilements to destroy knows that he is delivered. </p>

<p>There are altogether 19 kinds of such reflective knowledge, 15 pertaining to 
the first three stages of Sainthood, and 4 to the last stage. </p>

<p>The Pāli phrase - <i>n&#39;āparam itthatthāya</i> - No more of this state again - 
refers to this process of reflection. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>48. <b>Nānadassanavisuddhi</b> is the name given to the contemplative 
knowledge, a mental state of wisdom found in the Path-Consciousness. It is 
called a &#39;purity&#39;, because it is completely free from all stains or defilements, 
resulting from the realization of the four Truths. It is the seventh &#39;purity&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emancipation</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 7. Therein, the contemplation of no-soul, that discards the clinging to a 
soul (49), becomes an avenue of Emancipation and is termed &#39;Void-contemplation&#39;. 
The contemplation of impermanence, that discards the signs of false notion (50), 
becomes an avenue of Emancipation, and is termed &#39;Signless-contemplation. The 
contemplation of suffering, that discards the hankering of attachment (51), 
becomes an avenue of Emancipation and is termed &#39;Unhankering-contemplation&#39; . </p>

<p>Hence if with the Emergence Insight leading to the Path, one contemplates on 
no-soul, then the Path is known as &#39;Void-Emancipation&#39;; if one contemplates on 
impermanence then the Path is known as &#39;Signless-Emancipation; if one 
contemplates on sorrow, then the Path is known as &#39;Unhankering-Emancipation. 
Thus the Path receives three names according to the way of Insight. Likewise, 
the Fruit, (occurring) in the Path thought-process, receives these three names 
according to the way of the Path. </p>

<p>However, in the thought-process as regards the attainment to fruition, to 
those who contemplate in the foregoing manner, the Fruits that arise 
respectively in each case, are termed &#39;Void-Emancipation&#39;, etc., only in 
accordance with the way of Insight. But, as regards objects and respective 
functions, the triad of names is applied equally to all (Paths and Fruits) 
everywhere. </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Emancipation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individuals</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 8. Herein, developing the Path of Stream-Attainment (52), eradicating false 
views and doubts, and escaping from going to woeful states, one becomes a 
Stream-Winner who is born seven times at most. </p>

<p>Developing the Path of once-Returning (53), and attenuating lust, hatred, and 
ignorance, one becomes a Once-Returner, returning to this world only once. </p>

<p>Developing the path of Never-Returning (54), and totally eradicating sensual 
desires and hatred, one becomes a Never-Returner not returning to this 
(Sentient) state.</p>

<p>Developing the Path of the Worthy, and totally eradicating all defilements, 
one becomes a Worthy One (55), who is free from Corruptions, and who is fit to 
receive the highest offerings in this world. </p>

<p>Herein this is the section on Individuals. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>49. <b>Attābhinivesa</b> - The stronghold of a soul like the doer of action, 
the reaper of fruit, &#39;this is my soul&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>50. <b>Vipallāsanimittam</b> - Three <i>vipallāsas</i> or misconceptions are 
discarded by meditating on &#39;impermanence&#39;. They are &#39;erroneous perception&#39; <i>
(saññā-vipallāsa),</i> &#39;erroneous ideas&#39; <i>(citta-vipallāsa),</i> and 
&#39;erroneous views&#39; <i>(ditthi-vipallāsa). </i>On account of these three 
misconceptions people regard what is impermanent as permanent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>51. <b>Tanhāpanidhi</b> - Such hankerings like &#39;this is mine&#39;, &#39;this is 
happiness&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52. <b>Sotāpanno</b> - One who has entered the stream that leads to Nibbāna 
for the first time. There are three classes of Sotāpannas, namely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. Those who will be born seven times at most in heavenly and earthly 
  realms <i>(sattakkhattuparama).</i> Before seeking an eighth birth, they 
  attain Arahatship. </p>
  <p>ii. Those who seek birth in noble families two or three times before they 
  attain Arahatship (kolamkola). </p><p>iii. Those who are born only once more before they attain Arahatship <i>
	(ekabījī). </i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Sotāpanna has unshakable confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha. 
He neither violates the five precepts nor commits the heinous crimes. Free from 
birth in woeful states, he is ever destined for enlightenment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. Sakadāgāmi - One who returns to this world of human beings only once. 
After attaining Sakadāgāmi in this life, he may be born in a heavenly realm and 
attain Arahatship seeking birth in the human plane. </p>

<p>There are five kinds of Sakadāgāmis, namely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi here and attain Parinibbāna here 
		itself. </p>
        <p>ii. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi in a heavenly realm and attain 
		Parinibbāna there.</p>
        <p>iii. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi here and attain Parinibbāna in a 
		heavenly realm. </p>
        <p>iv. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi in a heavenly realm and attain 
		Parinibbāna in this human plane. </p>
        <p>v. Those who attain Sakadāgāmi here and, having being born in a 
		heavenly realm, seek birth in this human plane and attain Parinibbāna.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>54. <b>Anāgāmi</b> - one who will not return to this Sense sphere <i>
(kāmaloka).</i>
Such beings are born in the &#39;Pure Abodes&#39; <i>(suddhāvāsa),</i> higher Brahma 
realms where Anāgāmis abide till they attain Arahatship. </p>

<p>There are five classes of Anāgāmis: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i. Those who attain Parinibbāna within the first half life-span in 
		the Pure Abodes (antaraparinibbāyi). </p><p>ii. Those who attain Parinibbāna having lived more than half a 
		  life-span (upahaccaparinibbāyi).</p><p>iii. Those who attain Parinibbāna with exertion (sasankhāra 
		  parinibbāyi).</p><p>iv. Those who attain Parinibbāna without exertion (asasankhāra 
		  parinibbāyi).</p><p>v. Those who, passing beyond one Brahma realm to another higher 
		  Brahma realm, attain Parinibbāna in the Highest Brahma realm <i>
		  (uddhamsota akanitthagāmi).</i> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>55. <b>Khīnāsavo</b> - synonymous with an Arahat, a Worthy One, because he 
has destroyed all the defilements. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Path of Purification</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the <i>jhānas</i> are developed, the mind is so purified, that it 
resembles a polished mirror, where everything is clearly reflected in true 
perspective. Still, there is not complete freedom from unwholesome thoughts, 
for, by concentration, the evil tendencies are only temporarily inhibited. They 
may rise to the surface at quite unexpected moments. </p>

<p>Discipline regulates words and deeds; concentration controls the mind; but it 
is Insight <i>(paññā)</i> the third and the final stage, that enables the 
aspirant to Sainthood to eradicate wholly the defilements inhibited by <i>
samādhi</i>. </p>

<p>At the outset he cultivates &#39;Purity of Vision&#39; <i>(ditthi visuddhi)</i>
(the third member of the Path of Purity) in order to see things as they truly 
are. With a one-pointed mind he analyses and examines this so-called being. This 
searching examination shows that what he has called &#39;I&#39;, is merely a complex 
compound of mind and matter which are in a state of constant flux. </p>

<p>Having thus gained a correct view of the real nature of this so-called being, 
freed from the false notion of a permanent soul, he searches for the causes of 
this &#39;I&#39; personality. He realizes that there is nothing in the world which is 
not conditioned by some cause or causes, past or present, and that his present 
existence is due to past ignorance <i>(avijjā),</i> craving <i>(tanhā),</i> 
attachment <i>(upādāna),</i> Kamma, and physical food of the present life. On 
account of these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and as past causes 
have conditioned the present, so the present will condition the future. 
Meditating thus, he transcends all doubts with regard to past, present and 
future (<i>kankhāvitaranavisuddhi,</i> the fourth member of the Path of Purity). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thereupon he contemplates the truth that all conditioned things are transient <i>
(anicca), </i>subject to suffering <i>(dukkha),</i> and devoid of an immortal 
soul <i>(anattā).</i> Wherever he turns his eyes he sees naught but these three 
characteristics standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a flux 
conditioned by internal and external causes. Nowhere does he find any genuine 
happiness for everything is fleeting. </p>

<p>As he thus contemplates the real nature of life, and is absorbed in 
meditation a day comes, when, to his surprise, he witnesses an aura <i>(obhāsa)</i>
emitted by his body. He experiences an unprecedented pleasure happiness and 
quietude. He becomes even-minded, his religious fervour increases, mindfulness 
becomes clear and insight keen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress 
for Sainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking 
for this mental state. Soon the realization comes that these new developments 
are impediments to moral progress and he cultivates the purity of knowledge with 
regard to the Path and Non-Path (<i>maggāmaggañānadassanavisuddhi,</i>
the fifth member of the Path of Purity).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditation on the arising <i>(udaya 
ñāna)</i> and passing away <i>(vaya ñāna)</i> of all conditioned things. Of 
these two states the latter becomes more impressed on his mind since change is 
more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore he directs his attention to 
contemplation of the dissolution of things
<i>(bhanga ñāna).</i> He perceives that both mind and matter which constitute 
this so-called being are in a state of constant flux, not remaining the same for 
two consecutive moments. To him then comes the knowledge that all dissolving 
things are fearful <i>(bhaya ñāna).</i> The whole world appears to him like a 
pit of burning embers, a source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the 
wretchedness and vanity <i>(ādīnava ñāna) </i>of the fearful and deluded world, 
and develops a feeling of disgust <i>(nibbidā ñāna),</i> followed by a strong 
will for deliverance from it <i>(muñcitukamyatā ñāna). </i></p>

<p>With this object in view, he resumes his meditation on the three 
characteristics of transiency, sorrow, and soullessness <i>(patisankhā ñāna),</i> 
and thereafter develops complete equanimity towards all conditioned things, 
having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly object <i>(upekkhā 
ñāna).*</i> <a NAME="page429"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* These nine kinds of Insight - namely, <i>udaya, vaya, bhanga, bhaya, 
ādīnava, nibbidā, muñcitukamyatā, patisankhā, upekkhā ñānas</i> are collectively 
termed <i>patipadāñānadassanavisuddhi</i> and <i>anuloma</i> - Purity of Vision 
in discerning the method the sixth number of the Path of Purity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reaching this point of spiritual culture, he chooses one of the three 
characteristics for his object of special endeavour and intently cultivates 
Insight in that particular direction until the glorious day when he first 
realizes Nibbāna,* his ultimate goal. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Insight found in this supramundane Path Consciousness is known as <i>
nānadassana</i>
<i>visuddhi</i> - Purity of Vision regarding intuitive wisdom, the seventh 
member of the Path of Purity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;As the traveler by night sees the landscape around him by a flash of 
lightning, and the picture so obtained swims long thereafter before his dazzled 
eyes, so the individual seeker, by the flashing light of insight, glimpses 
Nibbāna with such clearness that the after-picture never more fades from his 
mind&quot;. (Dr. Paul Dahlke)</p>

<p>When the spiritual pilgrim realizes Nibbāna for the first time he is called a 
Sotāpanna (s<font SIZE="2">ee Chapter I)</font> - one who has entered the stream 
that leads to Nibbāna for the first time. </p>

<p>The Stream represents the noble Eightfold Path. </p>

<p>A Stream-Winner is no more a worldling (puthujjana), but an Ariya (Noble). </p>

<p>On attaining this first stage of Sainthood he eradicates the following three 
Fetters <i>(samyojana)</i> that bind him to existence, namely: </p>

  <p>1. <b>Sakkāya-ditthi</b> - <i>sati + kāye + ditthi,</i> literally, view 
  when a group exists. Here <i>kāya</i> refers to the five Aggregates of matter, 
  feeling, perception, mental states, and consciousness, or, in other words, to 
  the complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging 
  entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho physical 
  aggregates is termed <i>sakkāya-ditthi.</i>
  Dhammasangani enumerates twenty kinds of such soul theories (s<font SIZE="2">ee 
  Dhammasangani Translation, pp. 257-259)</font>. <i>Sakkāya-ditthi</i> is 
  usually rendered by self-illusion, theory of individuality, illusion of 
  individualism. </p>
  <p>2. <b>Vicikicchā</b> - Doubts. They are doubts about 1. the Buddha, 2. the 
  Dhamma, 3. the Sangha, 4. the disciplinary rules <i>(sikkhā), </i>5. the past, 
  6. the future, 7. both the past and the future, and 8. Dependent Arising <i>
  (paticca-samuppāda).</i>
  (see Dhammasangani Translation p. 239)</p><p>3. <b>Sīlabbataparāmāsa</b> - Adherence to (wrongful) rites and 
	ceremonies. </p>
  <p>Dhammasangani explains it thus: &quot;It is the theory held by ascetics an 
  Brahmins outside this doctrine, that purification is obtained by rules of 
  moral conduct, or by rites, or by both rules of moral conduct and rites&quot;. </p>

<p>For the eradication of the remaining seven Fetters a Sotāpanna is reborn 
seven times at most. He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and 
the Sangha. He would not for any reason violate any of the five precepts. He is 
not subject to states of woe as he is destined for Enlightenment. </p>

<p>With fresh courage as a result of this distant glimpse of Nibbāna, the noble 
pilgrim makes rapid progress, and perfecting his Insight, becomes a Sakadāgāmi - 
Once-Returner - reaching the second stage of Sainthood by attenuating two other 
Fetters, namely, sense-desires <i>(kāmāraga)</i> and ill will <i>(patigha).</i> </p>

<p>Now he is called a Once-Returner because he is born in the human realm only 
once, should he not attain Arahatship in that birth itself. It is interesting to 
note that the Ariya Saint who has attained the second stage of Sainthood can 
only weaken these two powerful Fetters with which he is bound from a 
beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he harbours thoughts of 
lust and anger. </p>

<p>It is by attaining the third State of Sainthood, that of the Anāgāmi 
(Never-Returner), that he completely eradicates these two Fetters. Thereafter he 
neither returns to this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, since he 
has rooted out the desire for sensual gratification. After death he is reborn in 
the Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsa), an environment exclusively reserved for Anāgāmis 
and Arahats. </p>

<p>A layman may become an Anāgāmi, provided he leads a celibate life. </p>

<p>The Anāgāmi Saint now makes his final advance and destroying the remaining 
five Fetters, namely, attachment to Realms of Form <i>(rūparāga)</i>
attachment to Formless Realms <i>(arūparāga),</i> pride <i>(māna), </i>
restlessness <i>(uddhacca),
</i>and ignorance <i>(avijjā), </i>attains Arahatship the final state of 
Sainthood. </p>

<p>Stream-Winners, Once-Returners, Never-Returners are called Sekhas because 
they have yet to undergo training. Arahats are called Asekhas because they no 
longer need any training. </p>

<p>An Arahat, literally, a Worthy One, is not subject to rebirth because he does 
not accomplish fresh Karmic activities, the seeds of his reproduction in matter 
have all been destroyed. </p>

<p>The Arahat realizes that what was to be accomplished has been done. A heavy 
burden of sorrow has finally been relinquished, and all forms of craving and all 
shades of ignorance are totally annihilated. The happy pilgrim now stands on 
heights more than celestial, far removed from uncontrolled passions and the 
defilements of the world. </p>

<p>Attainments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 9. Herein &#39;the Attainment to Fruition&#39; is common to all in accordance with 
their respective fruits. </p>

<p>But &#39;the Attainment to Cessation (56) is possible only to Never-Returners and 
Arahats. </p>

<p>In this case, one attains successively to the great ecstasies like the first <i>
jhāna,</i> etc., and emerging therefrom contemplates on the conditioned things 
in each of those <i>jhānas.</i> Thus he proceeds up to &#39;the State of 
Nothingness&#39;. Then, having attended to the preliminary duties such as resolving, 
etc., he attains to the state of Neither-Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;. Now 
after two ecstatic <i>javana</i>
thought-moments his stream of consciousness is suspended. Thereafter he attains 
to (Supreme) &#39;Cessation&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the time of rising, if to a Never-Returner, an Anāgāmi Fruit consciousness 
or to an Arahat, an Arahat Fruit consciousness, occurs only for a single moment 
and then lapses into <i>bhavanga.</i> This is followed by the knowledge of 
reflection. </p>

<p>Herein this is the Section on Attainments. </p>

<p>The end of exercises on mental culture or Insight. </p>

<p>One who wishes to enjoy the essence of practice in this Dispensation should 
thus develop the sublime dual meditation. </p>

<p>This is the ninth chapter of the Compendium of Abhidhamma which deals with 
the Exercise on Meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aspirations </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As invited by Namba, a person of refined manners, belonging to a respectable 
family, full of faith and replete with sterling virtues, to compose a treatise 
out of compassion for others, this book has been completed. </p>

<p>By this great merit may the modest monks, ho are purified by wisdom and who 
shine in discipline, remember till the end of the world the most famous 
Tumūlasoma Monastery, the abode of grain, for the acquisition of merit and for 
their happiness. </p>

<p>Thus ends the treatise called the Abhidhammattha Sangaha composed by the 
great teacher, Anuruddha.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>56. <b>Nirodhasamāpatti</b> - Lit., &#39;attainment to cessation&#39;. It is so 
called because during this period the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases 
to flow. Mind is suspended, but vitality persists. </p>

<p>It is only an Anāgāmi or an Arahat who has developed the <i>rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i> <i>jhānas</i> who can attain to this supreme state of ecstasy. </p>

<p>When such a person wishes to attain to <i>nirodhasamāpatti,</i> he first 
attains to the first <i>jhāna</i> and, emerging from it, he meditates on the 
transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness of conditioned states found in that 
particular
<i>jhāna.</i> Likewise, he attains, in order, to the remaining <i>jhānas</i> and 
meditates in the same way until the <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of &#39;Nothingness&#39;.</p>

<p>Emerging from this <i>jhāna,</i> he makes the following four resolutions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(i) that his fourfold requisites be not destroyed, </p>
        <p>(ii) that he should arise in time when his services are needed by the 
		Sangha, </p>
        <p>(iii) that he should arise in time when he is summoned by the Buddha, </p>
        <p>(iv) whether he will live for more than seven days from that moment. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>He has to think of his age-limit as this ecstatic state normally extends to 
seven days. </p>

<p>After making these resolutions, he attains to the last <i>arūpaj jhāna</i> of 
&#39;Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&#39;, and remains in that state for two <i>
javana</i>
thought moments. Immediately after, he attains to <i>nirodha-samāpatti</i> when 
his stream of consciousness, is temporarily suspended. After seven days he 
emerges from this state and experiences for a single moment an Anāgāmi Phala 
consciousness in the case of an Anāgāmi, or an Arahat Phala consciousness in the 
case of an Arahat. Thereafter arises the <i>bhavanga citta. </i></p>
