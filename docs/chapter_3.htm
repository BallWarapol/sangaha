<p>(i. Summary of Feeling) </b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>§ 2. In the summary of feeling (3) there are at first three kinds: - 
	pleasurable (4), painful, and that which is neither pleasurable nor painful. 
	Or, again, it is fivefold - namely, happiness, pain, pleasure, displeasure, 
	and indifference or equanimity. </p>
    <p>§ 3. Of them, moral resultant body-consciousness is the only one 
	accompanied by happiness. </p>
    <p>§ 4. Similarly immoral resultant body-consciousness is the only one 
	accompanied by pain. </p>
    <p>§ 5. There are sixty two kinds of consciousness accompanied by pleasure 
	(5) - namely: </p>
    <p>(a) the eighteen types of Sense-sphere consciousness, such as four rooted 
	in attachment, twelve types of sense-sphere Beautiful consciousness, the two 
	types of investigating and smiling consciousness, </p>
    <p>(b) forty-four types (6) of Sublime and Supramundane consciousness 
	pertaining to the first, second, third, and fourth Jhānas. (12 + 32) </p>
    <p>§ 6. Only the two types of consciousness connected with aversion are 
	accompanied by displeasure (7). </p>
    <p>§ 7. All the remaining fifty-five types of consciousness are accompanied 
	by indifference or equanimity (8). </p>
    <p>§ 8. Feeling, therein, is threefold - namely, happiness, pain, and 
	indifference. Together with pleasure and displeasure it is fivefold. </p>

<p>Happiness and pain are found in one, displeasure in two, pleasure in 
sixty-two, and the remaining (indifference or equanimity) in fifty-five. </p>

<h4>Notes - </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Vedanā</b> is a significant mental state which is common to all types 
of consciousness. Feeling is its characteristic <i>(vedayita-lakkhana), </i>and 
is born of contact. Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering for <i>
vedanā. </i></p>

<p>Feeling is defined as: &quot;a conscious, subjective impression which does not 
involve cognition or representation of an object.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Sensation is explained as: &quot;the content of sensuous intuition, or the way in 
which a conscious subject is modified by the presence of an object.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Vedanā</i> modifies the stream of consciousness and serves both as a 
life-promoting and life-destroying force. Pleasure, for example, promotes life; 
pain impairs it. As such feeling plays a very important part in the life of man. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experiencing the taste of an object is the function of <i>vedanā (anubhavana 
rasa).</i> Particular likes and dislikes depend on the desirability and the 
undesirability of the external object. Generally they are mechanistic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes the freewill of a person determines the mode of feeling independent 
of the nature of the object. The sight of an enemy, for example, would normally 
be a source of displeasure, but a right-understanding person would, on the 
contrary, extend his loving-kindness towards him and experience some kind of 
pleasure. Socrates, for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and faced a 
happy death. Once a certain Brahman poured a torrent of abuse on the Buddha, but 
He kept smiling and returned love unto him. The ascetic Khantivādi, who was 
brutally tortured by a drunkard king, wished him long life instead of cursing 
him. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the other hand, may even, at the sight of a 
Buddha, harbour a thought of hatred. His feeling will be one of displeasure. 
Likewise a similar feeling may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhist at the 
sight of a religious teacher of an alien faith. What is meat and drink to one, 
may be poison to another. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Material pleasures, for instance, would be highly prized by an average 
person. An understanding recluse would find happiness in renouncing them and 
leading a life of voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a solitary life, a 
sensualist may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven to one may be hell to another; 
what is hell to one may be heaven to another. We ourselves create them, and they 
are more or less mind-made. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;There are, o Bhikkhus, two kinds of feeling-pain and happiness&quot;, says the 
Buddha. Well, then, how can there be a third which is neither pain nor 
happiness? The commentary states that blameless neutral feeling is included in 
happiness and the blameworthy in pain. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, the Buddha has stated that whatever is felt in this world, all that is 
pain. It is because of the changeable nature of all conditioned things. </p>

<p>From another standpoint considering all forms of feeling as purely mental, 
there are only three kinds - namely, happiness <i>(sukha),</i> pain <i>(dukkha), </i>
and neutral <i>(adukkhamasukha). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atthasālini explains them, as follows:-</p>

<p>The term <i>sukha</i> means &#39;pleasurable feeling&#39; <i>(sukha-vedanā), </i>
&#39;root of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-mūla),</i> &#39;pleasurable object&#39; <i>(sukhārammana),</i> 
&#39;cause of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-hetu),</i> &#39;conditioning state of pleasure, <i>
(sukha-paccayatthāna),</i>
free from troubles&#39; <i>(abyāpajjhā),</i> &#39;Nibbāna&#39;, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the expression: &quot;By eliminating <i>sukha</i>&quot; - <i>sukha</i>
means pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p>In the expression: &quot;<i>Sukha</i> is non-attachment in this world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means root of pleasure. </p>

<p>In the expression: &quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>sukha,</i> falls and descends 
on sukha&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means object of pleasure. </p>

<p>&quot;Merit, o Bhikkhus, is a synonym for <i>sukha</i>.&quot; Here <i>sukha</i>
means cause of pleasure. </p>

<p>&quot;Not easy is it, o Bhikkhus, to attain to heavenly <i>sukha</i> by 
description&quot;. &quot;They know not <i>sukha</i> who do not see <i>nandana</i>&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means conditioning state of pleasure. </p>

<p>&quot;These states constitute a <i>sukha</i> life in this very world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means freedom from troubles.</p>

<p>&quot;Nibbāna is supreme <i>sukha&#39;&#39;.</i> Here <i>sukha</i> means Nibbāna. </p>

<p>From these quotations the reader can understand in what different senses the 
term <i>sukha</i> is used in the texts. In this particular connection the term <i>
sukha</i>
is used in the sense of pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p>Nibbāna is stated to be supreme bliss <i>(sukha). </i>This does not mean that 
there is a pleasurable feeling in Nibbāna although the term <i>sukha</i> is 
used. Nibbāna is a bliss of relief. The release from suffering is itself 
Nibbānic bliss.
</p>

<p>The term <i>dukkha</i> means &#39;painful feeling&#39;, &#39;basis of pain&#39;, object of 
pain&#39;, cause of pain&#39;, &#39;conditioning state of pain&#39;, etc. </p>

<p>&#39;&#39;By eliminating <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means painful feeling. </p>

<p>&quot;Birth too is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means basis of pain. </p>

<p>&quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>dukkha</i>, falls and descends on pain&quot; - here <i>
dukkha</i> means object of <i>dukkha. </i></p>

<p>&quot;Accumulation of evil is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i>
means cause of pain. </p>

<p>&quot;It is not easy, o Bhikkhus, to realize the pain of woeful states by 
description&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means &quot;conditioning states of pain.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this particular connection the term <i>dukkha</i> is used in the sense of 
painful feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Dhammacakka Sutta the Buddha enumerates eight divisions of <i>dukkha
</i>-namely: </p>

<p>1. Birth is suffering, 2. decay is suffering, 3. disease is suffering, 4. 
death is suffering, 5. association with the unpleasant is suffering, 6. 
separation from the beloved is suffering, 7. when one does not obtain what one 
desires there is suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering. </p>

<p>All these are the causes of <i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Buddha addresses Devas and men He speaks of eight kinds of <i>
dukkha.</i>
When He addresses only men He speaks of twelve. Instead of <i>vyādhi</i> 
(disease) He says <i>soka</i> (grief), <i>parideva</i> (lamentation), <i>dukkha</i> 
(pain), <i>domanassa</i>
(displeasure) <i>upāyāsa</i> (despair) are suffering. All these five are 
included in <i>vyādhi</i>
which embraces both physical and mental disharmony. </p>

<p><i>Soka, domanassa,</i> and <i>upāyāsa</i> are mental, while <i>dukkha</i>
and <i>parideva</i> are physical. </p>

<p>Practically there is no marked difference between the two formulas. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Adukkha-m-asukha</b> is that which is neither pain nor happiness. It is a 
neutral feeling. This corresponds to both stolid indifference and Stoic 
indifference. The Pāli term <i>upekkhā,</i> which has a wider connotation, is 
more frequently used to denote this kind of neutral feeling. </p>

<p>In an immoral type of consciousness <i>upekkhā</i> assumes the role of stolid 
indifference because it is prompted by ignorance. In an <i>ahetuka</i> resultant 
consciousness, such as a sense-impression, <i>upekkhā</i> means simple neutral 
feeling which has no ethical value. <i>Adukkha-m-asukha</i> strictly applies in 
this connection. <i>Upekkhā</i>
latent in a <i>kāmāvacara sobhana citta</i> (Beautiful type of consciousness 
pertaining to the Sense-sphere) may be any of the following states - simple 
indifference (not stolid because there is no ignorance), simple neutral feeling, 
disinterestedness, unbiased feeling, Stoic indifference, and perfect equanimity. </p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> in the <i>jhāna</i> consciousness is perfect equanimity born 
of concentration. It is both ethical and intellectual. </p>

<p>See Ch. 1, Note 42. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to a still wider classification <i>vedanā</i> is fivefold namely. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(i ) <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness),</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(ii) <i>somanassa</i> (mental pleasure),</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(iii) <i>dukkha</i> (physical pain), </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(iv) <i>domanassa</i> (mental displeasure), </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>(v) <i>upekkhā</i> (indifference, equanimity, or neutral feeling ) . </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All feelings, from an ultimate standpoint, are mental because <i>vedanā</i>
is a <i>cetasikā.</i> But a differentiation has been made with regard to <i>
sukha</i> and
<i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p>Of all the 89 types of consciousness only two are associated with either <i>
sukha</i> or <i>dukkha.</i> One is the body-consciousness associated with 
happiness, and the other is body-consciousness associated with pain. </p>

<p>Both these are the resultant types of consciousness, effects of good and evil 
Kamma.</p>

<p>A soft touch, for instance, yields happiness. A pinprick, on the contrary, 
yields pain. In these cases one experiences the aforesaid two types of 
consciousness respectively. </p>

<p>Now a question arises - Why only the body-consciousness is associated with 
happiness and pain? Why not the other sense-impressions? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Aung provides an answer in his introductory essay to the Compendium: -</p>

<p>&quot;The sense of touch alone is accompanied by the positive hedonic elements of 
pain and pleasure; the other four senses are accompanied by hedonic 
indifference. This exceptional distinction is assigned to the sense of touch, 
because the impact between the sentient surface <i>(pasāda rūpa) </i>and the 
respective objects of other senses, both sets of which are secondary qualities 
of body, is not strong enough to produce physical pain or pleasure. But in the 
case of touch there is contact with one or other, or all the three primary 
qualities (locality - <i>pathavī,</i> temperature - <i>tejo,</i>
pressure - <i>vāyo)</i> and this is strong enough to affect those primary 
qualities in the percipient&#39;s own body. Just as cotton wool on the anvil does 
not affect the latter, but a hammer striking cotton wool imparts its check to 
the anvil also.&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Compendium of Philosophy p. 14). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of touch the impact is strong. The &quot;essentials&quot;, <i>pathavī, tejo</i> 
and <i>vāyo</i> (extension, heat, and motion) - <i>āpo,</i> cohesion, is 
excluded being intangible - forcibly and directly strike against the essentials 
of the body. Consequently there is either pain or happiness. In the case of 
seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting, there is a bare impact. The consequent 
feeling is neither pain nor happiness. </p>

<p>Although these sense-impressions may be <i>sukha, dukkha,</i> or <i>upekkhā</i>
the <i>javana</i> thought processes conditioned thereby may not necessarily be 
associated with a similar feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, the Buddha experienced a body-consciousness associated with 
pain when a rock splinter struck His foot, but His <i>javana</i> thought-process 
conditioned thereby would not necessarily be associate with displeasure. 
Unaffected by the pain, He would have experienced perfect equanimity. The 
immanent feeling in the stream of consciousness would have been <i>upekkhā.</i> 
Similarly at the sight of the Buddha, a right-understanding person would 
automatically experience an eye-consciousness associated with indifference <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata cakkhu-viññāna)</i> but his <i>javana</i>
thought would be moral. The innate feeling would be pleasure <i>(somanassa). </i></p>

<p>This intricate point should be clearly understood. </p>

<p><i>Somanassa</i> (good-mindedness ) and <i>domanassa</i>
(bad-mindedness) are purely mental. </p>

<p>These five kinds of feeling could be reduced to three, the three to two, and 
the two to one as follows:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <p>i. <i>sukha + somanassa; upekkhā; dukkha + domanassa </p>
        </li>
        </i>
    <li><p>ii. <i>sukha ; upekkhā; dukkha </p>
        </li>
        </i>
    <li><p>iii. <i>sukha; dukkha </p>
        </li>
        </i>
    <li><p>iv. <i>dukkha</i> </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><i>(Upekkhā</i> is merged in <i>sukha,</i> and <i>sukha</i> is ultimately 
merged in <i>dukkha).</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Sukha</b> - physical happiness should be differentiated from <i>
somanassa</i>
- mental pleasure. So should <i>dukkha</i> - physical pain - be differentiated 
from <i>domanassa</i>
- mental displeasure. There is only one consciousness accompanied by <i>sukha.</i>
Similarly there is only one accompanied by <i>dukkha.</i> Both of them are the 
effects of good and bad actions respectively. </p>

<p>When the Buddha, for instance, was injured by Devadatta Thera, He experienced 
a body-consciousness accompanied by pain. This was the result of a past evil 
action of His. When we sit on a comfortable seat we experience a body 
consciousness accompanied by happiness. This is the result of a past good 
action. All forms of physical pain and happiness are the inevitable results of 
our own Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Readers will note that pleasurable types of consciousness exceed all 
others. As such during a life-time a person experiences more happy moments than 
painful ones. This does not contradict the statement that life is sorrow <i>
(dukkha). </i>Here <i>dukkha</i>
is not used in the sense of painful feeling but in the sense of oppression or 
impeding <i>(pīlana).
</i>A careful reading of the description of <i>dukkha,</i> given in the 
Dhammacakka Sutta will make the matter clear. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. They are the four <i>kusala jhānas,</i> four <i>vipāka jhānas,</i>
four <i>kriya jhānas,</i> and thirty-two <i>lokuttara jhānas.</i> (4 + 4 + 4 + 
32 = 44) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. There is displeasure only in the two types of consciousness connected with <i>
patigha</i> or aversion. We experience displeasure when we get angry. </p>

<p>Is there aversion where there is displeasure? Yes, in a gross or subtle form.

totaling twenty-two - are with two roots. </p>

<p>The twelve Sense-Sphere Beautiful types (15) of consciousness, associated

<p>For a detailed exposition of <i>hetu</i> see Dhammasangani <i>hetu-gocchakam,</i>
Sections 1053-1083; Buddhist Psychology, pp. 274-287.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Atthasālini there are four kinds of <i>hetu:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  </i><p>i. <i>hetu hetu,</i> the root cause or the root condition. </p>
  <p>There are three moral <i>hetus,</i> three immoral <i>hetus</i> and three 
  neutral <i>(avyākata) hetus.</i> Here <i>hetu</i> is used in the sense of 
  root. </p>
  <p>ii. <i>paccaya-hetu,</i> causal condition or instrumental cause. </p>
  <p>&quot;The four Great Essentials <i>(Mahābhūta),</i> o Bhikkhus, are the causes<i> 
  (hetu), </i>the conditions <i>(paccaya)</i> for the manifestation of 
  Form-Group <i>(rūpakkhandha).</i>&quot; </p>
  <p>Here <i>hetu</i> is used in the sense of causal relation <i>(paccaya-hetu).
  </p>
  <p></i>There is a subtle distinction between <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya.</i>
  The former signifies root <i>(mūla);</i> the latter, an aiding factor <i>

  paccaya</i> to manure, water and soil that aid its growth. </p>
  <p>This distinction should be clearly understood. </p>
  <p>It should also be noted that at times both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i>

</blockquote>

<p>10. All the <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are devoid of all roots. Hence they are 
neither moral nor immoral. They are regarded as unmoral. </p>

<p>Seven of them are the resultants of immoral actions, eight of moral actions, 
and three are merely functionals. See Ch. 1, pp. 27-31. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. i.e., 89-18 = 71. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. Namely, the consciousness accompanied by doubt <i>(vicikicchā) </i>and 
the other accompanied by restlessness <i>(uddhacca).</i> These are the only two 
types of consciousness that have one root, which is delusion. Being potentially 
weak, restlessness is powerless in determining a future birth. Both doubt and 
restlessness are regarded as two Fetters, the first of which is eradicated by 
the First Path, and the second by the Fourth Path of Sainthood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. The first eight immoral types of consciousness are connected with <i>
lobha</i>
(attachment) and <i>moha</i> (delusion) and the second two with <i>dosa</i> 
(aversion) and
<i>moha.</i> It should be noted that <i>moha</i> is common to all immoral 
thoughts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. Those twelve <i>kāmāvacara sobhana cittas</i> (mentioned in the first 
chapter) dissociated with <i>ñāna</i> or wisdom are conditioned by the two roots 
-
<i>alobha</i> (non-</p>

<p>attachment) and <i>adosa</i> (goodwill or loving-kindness). These two roots 
coexist in moral thoughts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. The remaining twelve <i>kāmāvacara sobhana cittas,</i>
accompanied by wisdom, are conditioned by all the three moral roots. </p>

<p>Similarly the 15 types of <i>rūpāvacara</i> consciousness, 12 types of <i>
arūpāvacara</i> consciousness, and the 8 types of <i>lokuttara</i> consciousness 
(15&nbsp;+&nbsp;12&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;= 35) are always associated with the three moral roots.</p>

<p>It should not be understood that evil thoughts conditioned by immoral roots 
do not arise in the <i>rūpaloka</i> and the <i>arūpaloka.</i> The point here 
stressed is that no immoral roots are found in the higher types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Unlike the other <i>kusala cittas,</i> the <i>lokuttara cittas,</i>
though associated with the three moral roots, lack procreative power. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Avyākata,</b> literally, means that which is not manifested. The term 
is applied to both <i>vipāka</i> (resultants) and <i>kriyā</i> (Functionals). <i>
Vipāka</i>
is a result in itself and is not productive of another result. <i>Kriya</i> does 
not produce any effect. <i>Rūpa</i> (material form) is also regarded as an <i>
avyākata</i>
because it does not reproduce any karmic result.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Ahetuka</i> - rootless types of consciousness = 18</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Ekahetuka</i> - types of consciousness with one root = 2</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>Three (35) perform the function of investigating. </p>

<p>The mind-door consciousness performs the function of determining (36) in the 
five sense-door (thought-process). </p>

<p>With the exception of two apprehending types of consciousness (37) the 
fifty-five (38) types of immoral, moral, and functional con<i>sc</i>iousness

<p>The eight great resultants and the three types of investigating 
consciousness, (totaling eleven) (39), perform the function of retention. </p>

<p>Of them the two types of investigating consciousness, accompanied by 
indifference, perform five functions such as relinking, life-continuum, decease, 
retention, and investigating. </p>

<p>The eight great resultants perform four functions such as relinking,

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>17. Kicca or Function. </b></p>

<p>In the first chapter consciousness was classified chiefly according to the 
nature <i>(jāti)</i> and planes or states <i>(bhūmi).</i> In this section the 
different functions of all the 89 types of consciousness are explained in 
detail.</p>

<p>Each consciousness performs a particular function. Some types of 
consciousness perform several functions, under different circumstances, in 
various capacities. There are fourteen specific functions performed by them all. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>18. Patisandhi, </b>literally, means re-linking. </p>

<p>The type of consciousness one experiences at the moment of conception is 
termed <i>patisandhi citta.</i> It is so called because it links the past with 
the present. </p>

<p>This <i>patisandhi citta,</i> also termed &#39;rebirth-consciousness,&#39; is 
conditioned by the powerful thought one experiences at the dying moment, and is 
regarded as the source of the present life-stream. In the course of one 
particular life there is only one <i>patisandhi citta.</i> The mental contents 
of <i>bhavanga,</i> which later arises an infinite number of times during one&#39;s 
lifetime, and of <i>cuti,</i> which arises only once at the final moment of 
death, are identical with those of <i>patisandhi. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>19. Bhavanga. </b><i>Bhava + anga</i> = factor of life, or indispensable 
cause or condition of existence. </p>

<p>One experiences only one thought-moment at any particular time. No two 
thought-moments coexist. </p>

<p>Each thought-moment hangs on to some kind of object. No consciousness arises 
without an object, either mental or physical. </p>

<p>When a person is fast asleep and is in a dreamless state he experiences a 
kind of consciousness which is more passive than active. It is similar to the 
consciousness one experiences at the initial moment of conception and at the 
final moment of death. This type of consciousness is in Abhidhamma termed <i>
bhavanga.</i> Like any other consciousness it also consists of three aspects - 
genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> static <i>(thiti)</i>
and cessation <i>(bhanga).</i> Arising and perishing every moment it flows on 
like a stream not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. </p>

<p>When an object enters this stream through the sense-doors, the <i>bhavanga</i>
consciousness is arrested and another type of consciousness appropriate to the 
object perceived arises. Not only in a dreamless state but also in our waking 
state we experience
<i>bhavanga</i> thought-moments more than any other types of consciousness. 
Hence <i>bhavanga</i>
becomes an indispensable condition of life. </p>

<p>Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. Aung compare <i>bhavanga</i> to &quot;Leibniz&#39;s state of 
obscure perception, not amounting to consciousness, in dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>One cannot agree because <i>bhavanga</i> is a type of consciousness. There is 
no obscure perception here. </p>

<p>Some identify <i>bhavanga</i> with sub-consciousness. According to the 
Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousness is &#39;&#39;a compartment of the mind 
alleged by certain psychologists and philosophers to exist below the threshold 
of consciousness.&quot; In the opinion of Western philosophers sub-consciousness and 
consciousness coexist. According to Abhidhamma no two types of consciousness 
coexist. Nor is <i>bhavanga</i> a sub-plane.</p>

<p>The Compendium further states that &quot;bhavanga denotes a functional state (or 
moment ) of sub-consciousness. As such it is the sub-conscious state of mind - 
&#39;below the threshold&#39; of consciousness - by which we conceive continuous 
subjective existence as possible. Thus it corresponds to F. W. Myer&#39;s 
&#39;subliminal consciousness&#39;&quot;.(<font SIZE="2"> p.266)</font></p>

<p>The Dictionary of Philosophy explains &#39;&#39;subliminal (sub, under + limen, the 
threshold) as allegedly unconscious mental processes especially sensations which 
lie below the threshold of consciousness.&quot; Strictly speaking, it does not 
correspond to subliminal consciousness either.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be any place for <i>bhavanga</i> in Western 
Psychology.</p>

<p><i>Bhavanga</i> is so called because it is an essential condition for 
continued subjective existence. </p>

<p>Whenever the mind does not receive a fresh external object, one experiences a <i>
bhavanga</i> consciousness.* Immediately after a thought-process, too, there is 
a <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness. Hence it is called <i>vīthimutta</i> - 
process-freed. Sometimes it acts as a buffer between two thought-processes . </p>

<p>Life continuum** has been suggested as the closest English equivalent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Cp. Susupti or deep sleep mentioned in the Upanishads. &quot;In it the mind and 
the sense are both said to be inactive&quot;. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, p. 
258.</p>

<p>** Radhakrishnan says .... Bhavanga is sub-conscious existence, or more 
accurately existence free from working consciousness, bhavanga is sub-conscious 
existence when subjectively viewed, though objectively it is sometimes taken to 
mean Nirvana Indian Philosophy, p. 408....This certainly is not the Buddhist 
conception. Bhavanga occurs in the waking consciousness too immediately after a 
citta-vīthi (thought-process). Bhavanga is never identified with Nibbāna.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>bhavanga</i> arises between, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>i . <i>patisandhi</i> (relinking) and <i>āvajjana</i> (apprehending), </p>
    <p>ii. <i>javana</i> and <i>āvajjana</i>, </p>
    <p>iii. <i>tadārammana</i> and <i>āvajjana,</i> </p>
    <p>iv. <i>votthapana</i> and <i>āvajjana,</i> and sometimes between </p>
    <p>v. <i>javana</i> and <i>cuti,</i> and </p>
    <p>vi. <i>tadārammana</i> and <i>cuti.</i> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>20. āvajjana-opening or turning towards. </b></p>

<p>When an object enters the <i>bhavanga</i> stream of consciousness the 
thought-moment that immediately follows is called <i>bhavanga-calana, (bhavanga</i>
vibration). Subsequently another thought-moment arises and is called the <i>
bhavanga-upaccheda</i>
(arresting <i>bhavanga).</i> Owing to the rapidity of the flow of <i>bhavanga</i> 
an external object does not immediately give rise to a thought-process. The 
original <i>bhavanga</i>
thought-moment perishes. Then the flow is checked. Before the actual transition 
of the <i>bhavanga</i>
it vibrates for one moment. When the <i>bhavanga</i> is arrested a 
thought-moment arises adverting the consciousness towards the object. If it is a 
physical object, the thought-moment is termed five-door cognition <i>
(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i> In the case of a mental object it is termed mind-door 
cognition <i>(manodvārāvajjana). </i></p>

<p>In the sense-door thought-process, after the <i>āvajjana</i> moment, arises 
one of the five sense-impressions. </p>

<p>See Ch. 1, N. 27. </p>

<p><i>āvajjana</i> arises between <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>pañca-viññāna</i>
(sense-impressions), and <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>javana. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>21. Pañca-viññāna</b> (sense-impressions) arise between five-door 
cognitions <i>(pañcadvārāvajjana)</i> and receiving consciousness <i>
(sampaticchana).</i>
Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and contacting are collectively termed <i>
pañca-viññāna.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>22. Sampaticchana</b> arises between five sense-impressions and 
investigating consciousness <i>(santīrana). </p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>23. Santīrana </b>arises between receiving consciousness and determining 
consciousness <i>(votthapana). </p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>24. Votthapana </b>= <i>Vi + ava +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>thā,</i> to stand, to fix, to rest, lit., thorough setting down. </p>

<p>It is at this moment that the nature of the object is fully determined. This 
is the gateway to a moral or immoral thought-process. Discrimination, rightly or 
wrongly employed at this stage, determines the thought-process either for good 
or evil. </p>

<p>There is no special class of consciousness called <i>votthapana.</i> <i>
Manodvārāvajjana</i>
(mind-door consciousness) performs the function of determining. </p>

<p><i>Votthapana</i> arises between </p>

<p>i. investigation and <i>javana,</i> and </p>

<p>ii. investigation and <i>bhavanga. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>25. Javana </b>derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ju,</i>
to run swiftly. </p>

<p>This is another important technical term which should be clearly understood. </p>

<p>Ordinarily the term is employed in the sense of swift. <i>Javanahamsa,</i>
for example, means swift swan; <i>javana-paññā</i> means swift understanding. In 
the Abhidhamma it is used in a purely technical sense. </p>

<p>Here Javana means running. It is so called because in the course of a 
thought-process it runs consecutively for seven thought-moments or five, hanging 
on to an identical object. The mental states occurring in all these thought 
moments are similar, but the potential force differs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the consciousness perceives a vivid object usually seven moments of 
Javana arise in the particular thought-process. In the case of death or when the 
Buddha performs the Twin Psychic Phenomenon <i>(Yamaka Pātihāriya)</i> only five 
thought moments arise. In the Supramundane Javana process the Path-consciousness 
arises only for one moment. </p>

<p>This javana stage is the most important from a ethical standpoint. It is at 
this psychological stage that good or evil is actually done. Irrespective of the 
desirability or the undesirability of the object presented to the mind, one can 
make the Javana process good or bad. If, for instance, one meets an enemy, a 
thought of hatred will arise almost automatically. A wise and forbearing person 
might, on the contrary, harbour a thought of love towards him. This is the 
reason why the Buddha has stated in the Dhammapada (V. 165)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;By self is evil done,</p>
            <p>By self is one defiled,</p>
            <p>By self is no evil done,</p>
            <p>By self is one purified.&quot; </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>True indeed that circumstances, habitual tendencies, environment, etc., 
condition our thoughts. Then the freewill is subordinated to the mechanistic 
course of events. There is also the possibility to overcome those external 
forces and, exercising one&#39;s own freewill, generate either good or bad thoughts. </p>

<p>A foreign element may be instrumental, but we ourselves are directly 
responsible for our own actions.</p>

<p>Of the normal seven Javana thought moments, the first is the weakest 
potentially as it lacks any previous sustaining force. The Karmic effect of this 
thought-moment may operate in this present life itself. It is called the <i>
ditthadhammavedaniya kamma.</i> If it does not operate, it becomes ineffective <i>
(ahosi).</i> The last is the second weakest, because the sustaining power is 
being spent. Its Karmic effect may operate in the immediately subsequent life <i>
(upapajjavedaniya). </i>If it does not, it also becomes ineffective. The effects 
of the remaining five may operate at any time till one attains Parinibbāna <i>
(aparāpariya-vedanīya). </i></p>

<p>It should be understood that moral and immoral <i>javanas</i> <i>
(kusalākusala)
</i>refer to the active side of life <i>(kamma-bhava).</i> They condition the 
future existence <i>(upapattibhava). </i>Apart from them there are the <i>phala*</i> 
and <i>kriyā javanas.</i> In the <i>Kriyā javanas,</i> which are experienced 
only by Buddhas and Arahats, the respective <i>cetanās</i> lack Kamma creative 
power. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[*<font SIZE="2"> Note the terrn used is <i>phala</i> (Fruit), but not <i>
vipāka.</i>
In the <i>lokuttara javana</i> process the Path-Consciousness is immedlately 
followed by the Fruit-Consciousness.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to suggest a suitable rendering for Javana. </p>

<p>&#39;&#39;Apperception&#39;&#39; is suggested by some. </p>

<p>The Dictionary of Philosophy defines apperception as &quot;the introspective or 
reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states. Leibniz, who 
introduced the term, distinguished between perception (the inner state as 
representing outer things) and apperception (the inner state as reflectively 
aware of itself). In Kant, apperception denotes the unity of self-consciousness 
pertaining to either the empirical ego (empirical apperception) or to the pure 
ego (transcendental apperception).&quot; p. 15. </p>

<p>Commenting on Javana Mrs. Rhys Davids says:- </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;I have spent many hours over Javana, and am content to throw apperception 
overboard for a better term, or for Javana, untranslated and as easy to 
pronounce as our own &#39;javelin.&#39; It suffices to remember that it is the mental 
aspect or parallel of that moment in nerve-process, when central function is 
about to become efferent activity or &#39;innervation.&#39; Teachers in Ceylon associate 
it with the word &#39;dynamic.&#39; And its dominant interest for European psychologists 
is the fusion of intellect and will in Buddhist Psychology....&quot;</p>

<p>(Compendium of Philosophy, p . 249). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Impulse is less satisfactory than even apperception. As Mrs. Rhys Davids 
suggests it is wise to retain the Pāli term. </p>

<p>See Compendium of Philosophy, pp. 42-45, 249. </p>

<p>According to the Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>javana</i> occurs between: </p>

<p>(i) <i>votthapana</i> and <i>tadārammana,</i> (ii) <i>votthapana</i>
and <i>bhavanga</i>, (iii) <i>votthapana</i> and <i>cuti,</i> (iv) <i>
manodvārāvajjana</i>
and <i>bhavanga,</i> (v) <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> and <i>cuti.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>26. Tadālambana or Tadārammana,</b> literally, means &#39;that object.&#39; 
Immediately after the Javana process two thought-moments, or none at all, arise 
having for their object the same as that of the Javana. Hence they are called <i>
tadālambana.</i>
After the <i>tadālambanas</i> again the stream of consciousness lapses into <i>
bhavanga</i>.
</p>

<p><i>Tadālambana</i> occurs between (i) <i>javana</i> and <i>bhavanga</i>
and (ii) <i>javana</i> and <i>cuti.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>27. Cuti </b>is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>cu,</i>
to depart, to be released. </p>

<p>As <i>patisandhi</i> is the initial thought-moment of life so is <i>cuti</i>
the final thought-moment. They are the entrance and exit of a particular life. <i>
Cuti</i>
functions as a mere passing away from life. <i>Patisandhi, bhavanga</i> and <i>
cuti</i> of one particular life are similar in that they possess the same object 
and identical mental co-adjuncts. </p>

<p>Death occurs immediately after the <i>cuti</i> consciousness. Though, with 
death, the physical body disintegrates and the flow of consciousness temporarily 
ceases, yet the life-stream is not annihilated as the Karmic force that propels 
it remains. Death is only a prelude to birth. </p>

<p><i>Cuti</i> occurs between (i) <i>javana</i> and <i>patisandhi,</i>
(ii) <i>tadārammana</i> and <i>patisandhi,</i> and (iii) <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>
patisandhi.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>28. Thāna, </b>lit., place, station, or occasion. Though there are 
fourteen functions yet, according to the functioning place or occasion, they are 
tenfold. The <i>pañca-viññāna</i> or the five sense-impressions are collectively 
treated as one since their functions are identical. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>29. </b>One is <i>akusala-vipāka</i> (immoral-resultant) and the other is <i>
kusala-vipāka</i> (moral-resultant). </p>

<p>Rebirth <i>(patisandhi)</i> in the animal kingdom, and in <i>peta</i>
and <i>asura</i> realms takes place with <i>upekkhāsahagata santīrana (akusala 
vipāka).</i>
<i>Bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> of that particular life are identical with this <i>
patisandhi citta. </i></p>

<p>Those human beings, who are congenitally blind, deaf, dumb, etc., have for 
their <i>patisandhi citta</i> the <i>kusala vipāka upekkhā-sahagata santīrana.</i>
Though deformity is due to an evil Kamma, yet the birth as a human is due to a 
good Kamma.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>30. </b>Namely, the <i>kāmāvacara kusala vipāka.</i> All human beings, who 
are not congenitally deformed, are born with one of these eight as their <i>
patisandhi citta.</i> </p>

<p>All these ten pertain to the <i>kāmaloka. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>31. </b>Namely, the five <i>rūpāvacara vipāka</i> and the four <i>
arūpāvacara vipāka. </p>

<p>Lokuttara</i> (Supramundane) <i>phalas</i> are not taken into consideration 
because they do not produce any rebirth.</p>

<p>Nineteen classes of consciousness, therefore, perform the triple functions of <i>
patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>32.</b> Namely, the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> (mind-door cognition) and the <i>
pañcadvārāvajjana</i> (sense-door cognition), mentioned among the 18 <i>ahetuka 
cittas.</i> The former occurs when the mind perceives a mental object, and the 
latter when it perceives a physical object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>33.</b> Namely, the ten types of moral and immoral resultant 
sense-impressions <i>(kusala-akusala vipāka pañca-viññāna). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>34.</b> Namely, the two types of receiving consciousness, accompanied by 
indifference, mentioned among the <i>ahetukas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>35. </b>Namely, the two accompanied by indifference, and one accompanied 
by pleasure. It is the first two that function as <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i>
and <i>cuti. </i></p>

<p>It should not be understood that at the moment of rebirth there is any 
investigation. One consciousness performs only one function at a particular 
time. This class of consciousness only serves as a rebirth-consciousness 
connecting the past and present births. </p>

<p>The investigating consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, occurs as a <i>
tadālambana</i>
when the object presented to the consciousness is desirable. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>36. </b>There is no special consciousness known as <i>votthapana.</i>
It is the manodvārāvajjana that serves this function in the five-door 
thought-process. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>37. </b>Namely, the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> and the <i>pañcadvārāvajjana,</i>
two of the <i>ahetuka kriya cittas.</i> As they do not enjoy the taste of the 
object they do not perform the function of Javana. The remaining <i>kriya citta,</i> 
smiling consciousness, performs the function of Javana. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>38. </b>Namely, 12 immoral + (8 + 5 + 4 + 4) 21 morals + 4 <i>lokuttara 
phalas</i> (Fruits) + (1 + 8 + 5 + 4) 18 functionals = 55. </p>

<p>The term used is not <i>vipāka</i> but <i>phala.</i> The <i>vipākas</i>
(resultants) of <i>kāma, rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa lokas</i> are not regarded as 
Javanas. The Supramundane Paths and Fruits which occur in the Javana process are 
regarded as Javanas though they exist only for a moment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>39. </b>These eleven are <i>vipāka cittas</i> (resultants). When they 
perform the function of retention <i>(tadālambana), </i>there is no 
investigating function. </p>

<p>The investigating consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, performs the dual 
functions of investigating and retention. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>40.</b> In their respective planes. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>41. </b><i>Manodvārāvajjana</i>, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>42.</b> <i>Manodhātu</i> is applied to the two classes of receiving 
consciousness <i>(sampaticchana)</i> and five-door cognition<i> 
(pañcadvārāvajjana).</i>
All the remaining classes of consciousness, excluding the ten sense impressions <i>
(dvipañca-viññāna),</i>
are termed <i>mano-viññāna dhātu.</i></p>

<p>Therein the eye itself is the eye-door; and so for the ear-door and others. 
But <i>bhavanga</i> is called the mind-door. </p>

<p>Of them forty-six (46) types of consciousness arise accordingly (47) in the

<p>Likewise in the ear-door and others forty-six types of consciousness arise 
such as five-door apprehending, ear-consciousness, and so forth. </p>

<p>It should be understood that in every way in the five-doors there are 
fifty-four types of kāmāvacara consciousness (48). </p>

<p>In the mind-door sixty-seven types of consciousness arise such as mind-door 
apprehending, fifty-five javanas (49), and retention (50). </p>

<p>Nineteen types of consciousness such as relinking, <i>bhavanga</i>, and 
decease are without doors (61). </p>

<p>Of those (that arise through doors) thirty-six types of consciousness (52) 
such as twice fivefold sense-impressions and the sublime and supramundane <i>
javanas</i>
(53) are with one door accordingly. </p>

<p>The three mind-elements (54)arise through five doors. </p>

<p>Pleasurable investigation (55), determining (56), and the <i>kama</i>-sphere
<i>javanas</i> arise through six doors. Investigation, accompanied by 
indifference, and the great Resultants arise either through the six doors or 
without a door (57). </p>

<p>The Sublime Resultants do arise without a door (58).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 9. Thirty-six (59) types of consciousness arise through one door, three 
through five, thirty-one through six, ten through six or without a door, nine 
wholly free from a door respectively. In five ways they are shown </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>43. Dvāra </b>or door, derived from <i>du,</i> two and <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>ar,</i> to go, to enter, is that which serves both as an entrance 
and an exit. Eye ear and other organs of sense act as doors for objects to 
enter.
</p>

<p>The five physical senses and the mind are regarded as the six doors through 
which objects gain entrance. </p>

<p>See Compendium of Philosophy, p. 85 N. 4. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>44. </b>By <i>cakkhu-dvāra</i> or eye-door is meant the sensory surface of 
the eye. The other doors should be similarly understood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>45. Mano-dvāra - Mind-door </b></p>

<p>It was explained earlier that when an object enters the mind the <i>bhavanga</i>
consciousness first vibrates for a moment and is then arrested. Subsequently <i>
āvajjana</i>
or apprehending thought-moment arises. In the case of a physical object it is 
one of the five sense-impressions. In the case of a mental object it is the <i>
manodvārāvajjana</i>
mind-door consciousness. The <i>bhavangupaccheda</i> (<i>bhavanga</i> arrest) 
thought-moment that immediately precedes the mind-door apprehending 
consciousness is known as the mind-door <i>(manodvāra). </i></p>

<p>Abhidhammāvatāra states -</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i></p>

<p>S&#39;āvajjanam bhavangantu manodvāranti vuccati. </i></p>

<p>(The <i>bhavanga</i> with the <i>āvajjana</i> is known as mind-door) .
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>46. The commentary sums up 46 as follows:-</b></p>

<p>(a) 1; (b) 2 <i>(akusala </i>and <i>kusala vipāka sampaticchana);</i>
(c) 2 <i>(akusala </i>and <i>kusala</i> <i>vipāka sampaticchana);</i> (d) 3 <i>
(akusala vipāka </i>= 1, <i>kusala vipāka santīrana</i> = 2), (e) 1; (f) 29 <i>
(akusala </i>= 12 + kusala = 8 + <i>ahetuka kriyā hasituppāda</i> = 1 + <i>
sobhana</i> <i>kriyā</i> = 8); (g) 8<i> (sobhana vipāka </i>- the other three 
being included in <i>santīrana). </i></p>

<p>1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 29 + 8 = 46</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forty-six types of consciousness arise through the eye-door with material 
form as the object<i> (rūpālambana).</i> An equal number arises in the remaining 
four physical doors with their respective objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47. Accordingly, yathāraham -</b></p>

<p>That is, &quot;according as the object is desirable or not, as attentiveness is 
right or wrong, as passion-freed individuals or not&quot; (Vibhāvini Tīkā). Mr. Aung 
says Ledi Sayadaw explains the same by &#39;According to the object, the plane of 
existence, the subject, attention, etc.&#39; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>48. </b>All types of kāmāvacara consciousness arise through these five 
doors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>49. </b>Namely, 12 <i>akusalas</i> + 1 <i>ahetuka kriyā</i> + 16 <i>
sobhana kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> + 10 <i>rūpāvacara kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> 
+ 8 <i>arūpāvacara kusala</i> and <i>kriyā</i> + 8 <i>lokuttara</i> <i>magga</i> 
and <i>phala.</i> (12 + 1 + 16 + l0 + 8 + 8 = 55)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>50. </b>Namely, 3 <i>santīranas</i> and 8 <i>sobhana vipākas.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>51.</b> <b>Dvāra-vimutta,</b> door-freed. </p>

<p>Vibhāvini Tīkā explains that they are so called because (i) they do not arise 
in any of the sense-doors such as eye etc., (ii) <i>bhavanga</i> itself is the 
mind-door, and (iii) they exist without receiving any new external object 
(pertaining to the present life). </p>

<p>The first reason applies to <i>cuti</i> and <i>patisandhi,</i> the second to <i>
bhavangupaccheda,</i> and the third to all <i>bhavanga</i>s and <i>cuti. </i></p>

<p>It was stated earlier that <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i>
of a particular life are similar because their objects and their co-adjuncts are 
identical although their functions differ. </p>

<p>At the moment of death a thought-process that conditions the future existence 
occurs. The object of this thought-process may be (i) a Kamma (action) which one 
has performed in the course of one&#39;s life. One recollects the deed as if being 
renewed. Strictly speaking, it is a recurring of the consciousness which one has 
experienced while performing the action. Or it may be (ii) any symbol <i>
(kamma-nimitta) </i>which was conspicuous during the performance of the action. 
It may also be (iii) characteristic symbol of the place in which one is bound to 
be reborn<i> (gati nimitta)*</i>. Taking one of these three as the object, the 
rebirth-consciousness takes place in the future existence. The object of the <i>
bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> of that particular existence is similar to that of 
the <i>patisandhi.</i> Hence it was stated above that they do not take any new 
external object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[* Referring to the object of the <i>patisandhi citta</i> Mr. Aung says in 
the Compendium - &quot;These have for their object either the past efficient action 
itself, or a symbol of that past action <i>(kamma-nimitta), </i>or a sign of the 
tendencies <i>(gati-nimitta)</i> that are determined by the force of that past 
action&quot; - p. 26. Here <i>gati-nimitta</i> means a sign or symbol of the place in 
which he is to be born, such as fire, flesh, celestial mansions, etc.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>52. </b>They arise in their respective doors such as eye, ear, etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>53. </b>All the 26 Sublime and Supramundane javanas arise through the 
mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>54.</b> The two <i>sampaticchana</i> and <i>pañcadvārāvajjana</i>
arise only through the five physical sense-doors. </p>

<p>Readers should note that at times all these three types of consciousness are 
collectively termed <i>manodhātuttika</i> (three mind-elements). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>55. </b>Pleasurable investigation arises through the five physical doors 
when the object presented is desirable. It occurs through the mind-door as a <i>
tadālambana.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>56. </b>This is the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> which functions purely as a 
mind-door apprehending consciousness and as a determining consciousness in a 
thought-process which arises through any of the five physical doors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>57.</b> When they function as <i>patisandhi, bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i>
they are door-freed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>58. </b>The nine <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara vipāka cittas</i> 
arise as <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> respective planes.

<p>(v. Summary of Objects)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 10. In the summary of objects (60) there are six kinds-namely, visible 
object (61), audible object (62), odorous object (63), sapid object (64), 
tangible object (65), and cognizable object (66). </p>

<p>Therein form itself is visible object. Likewise sound and so forth are the 
audible objects etc. But cognizable object is sixfold: - sensitive (parts of 
organs) (67) subtle matter (68), consciousness (69), mental states (70), Nibbāna 
(71), and concepts (72).</p>

<p>To all types of eye-door consciousness visible form itself is the object. 
That too pertains only to the present (73). Likewise sounds and so forth of the 
ear-door consciousness and so forth also pertain to the present (74). </p>

<p>But the six kinds of objects of the mind-door consciousness are accordingly 
(75) present, past, future, and independent of time. </p>

<p>(76) To the &#39;door-freed&#39; such as relinking, <i>bhavanga</i>, and decease any 
of the afore-said six becomes objects as they arise. They are grasped, mostly 
(77) through the six doors, pertaining to the immediately preceding life, as 
past or present object or as concepts. They are (technically) known as Kamma, a 
symbol of Kamma,&#39; or a symbol of the state of rebirth.&#39;*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>[*Mr. Aung translates this passages as follows:......</p>

<p>&quot;Further, the objects of those &#39;door-freed&#39; classes of consciousness which 
are called rebirth, life-continuum, and re-decease cognitions, are also of six 
kinds according to circumstances. They have usually been grasped (as object) in 
the immediately preceding existence by way of the six doors, they are objects of 
things either present or past, or they are concepts. And they are (technically) 
known as &#39;Karma&#39;, &#39;sign of Karma&#39;, or &#39;sign of destiny&#39;. Compendium of 
Philosophy&#39; p. 120.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of them eye-consciousness and so forth have respectively form and so forth as 
their single object. But the three mind-elements have five objects such as form 
and so forth. The remaining Sense-sphere Resultants and the smiling 
consciousness have wholly Sense-sphere objects. </p>

<p>The Immorals and the Javanas, dissociated with knowledge, have all objects 
except the Supramundane objects (78). </p>

<p>The Sense-sphere Morals and the super-intellect (79) consciousness, known as 
the fifth jhāna, have all objects except the Path and Fruit of Arahatship</p>

<p>The Sense sphere Functionals, associated with knowledge, super-intellect 
Function al consciousness (80 ) and the determining consciousness (81) have in 
all cases all kinds of objects (82). </p>

<p>(83) Amongst the <i>arūpa</i> consciousness the second and fourth have 
Sublime objects. All the remaining sublime types of consciousness have concepts 
(84 ) as objects. The Supramundane types of consciousness have Nibbāna as their 
object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 11. Twenty-five (85) types of consciousness are connected with lower 
objects (86); six (87) with the Sublime; twenty-one (88) with concepts (89); 
eight with Nibbāna. </p>

<p>Twenty (90) are connected with all objects except the Supramundane objects; 
five (91) in all except with the Highest Path and Fruit; and six (92) with all. </p>

<p>Sevenfold is their grouping. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>60. ārāmmanam or ālambanam -</b></p>

<p><i>ārāmmanam</i> is derived from <i>ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
ram,</i> to attach, to adhere, to delight. </p>

<p><i>ālambanam</i> is derived from<i> ā + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
lamb,</i> to hang upon. </p>

<p>That on which the subject hangs, or adheres to, or delights in, is <i>
ārammana</i>
or <i>ālambana.</i> It means an object. </p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma there are six kinds of objects, which may be 
classified as physical and mental. </p>

<p>Each sense has its corresponding object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>61. Rūpa</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>rup,</i>
to change, to perish. In its generic sense it means&#39; that which changes its 
colour owing to cold, heat, etc.&#39; <i>(sītunhādivasena vannavikāramāpajjatī&#39; ti 
rūpam). </i></p>

<p>Abhidhamma enumerates 28 kinds of <i>rūpa,</i> which will be descriptively 
dealt with in a special chapter. Here the term is used in its specific sense of 
object of sight. </p>

<p>The Vibhāvini Tīkā states, &quot;<i>Rūpa</i> is that which manifests itself by 
assuming a difference in colour, that which expresses the state of having 
penetrated into the heart.&quot; <i>(vannavikāram āpajjamānam rūpayati 
hadayangatabhāvam pakāsetī&#39; ti rūpam). </i></p>

<p><i>Rūpa</i> is the abode, range, field, or sphere of colour <i>(vannāyatana).</i>
It is the embodiment of colour. </p>

<p>It should be understood that according to Abhidhamma <i>rūpa</i>
springs from four sources - namely, Kamma, mind <i>(citta), </i>seasonal 
phenomena <i>(utu),</i>
and food <i>(āhāra). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>62. Sadda </b>or (sound) arises from the friction of elements of extension <i>
(pathavī dhātu).</i> There are four material elements <i>(bhūta rūpa)</i>
- namely, the element of extension <i>(pathavi),</i> the element of cohesion <i>
(āpo), </i>the element of heat <i>(tejo),</i> and the element of motion <i>
(vāyo). </i>These are the fundamental units of matter. They are always 
inter-dependent and inter-related. One element may preponderate over the other 
as, for example, the element of extension predominates in earth, the element of 
cohesion in water, the element of heat in fire, and the element of motion in 
air. </p>

<p>When an element of extension collides with a similar element there arises 
sound. It springs from both mind <i>(citta) </i>and seasonal phenomena <i>(utu). </i></p>

<p>Sounds are either articulate<i> (vykata) </i>or inarticulate <i>(avyākata).
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>63. Gandha</b> (odour) is derived from <i>gandh,</i> to express<i>
(sūcane).</i> It springs from all the four sources. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>64. Rasa</b> (taste) is diffused in all the elements. Only the sapidity 
that exists in them is regarded as <i>rasa. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>65. Photthabbārammana </b>- tangible object. It is not mere contact. With 
the exception of the element of cohesion all the remaining three elements are 
regarded as tangible, because the former cannot be felt by the body. </p>

<p>When these three elements, which constitute a tangible object, collide with 
the sensory surface of the body there arises either pain or pleasure according 
to the desirability or undesirability of the object. In the case of other 
objects there results only <i>upekkhā</i> - neutral feeling. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>66. Dhammārammana </b>includes all objects of consciousness. <i>Dhamma</i>
embraces both mental and physical phenomena. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>67.</b> The sensory surfaces of all the five organs are known as <i>
pasāda.</i>
In the case of eye, ear, nose, tongue the sensory surfaces are located in 
particular spots, while the sensory surface of the body pervades the whole 
system.</p>

<p>There are five kinds of <i>pasāda rūpa</i> corresponding to the five 
sense-organs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>68. Sukhuma rūpa -</b></p>

<p>Of the 28 kinds of <i>rūpa</i> 16 are classed as <i>sukhuma</i>
(subtle) and 12 as <i>odārika</i> (gross).</p>

<p>The physical objects of (i) sight, (ii) hearing, (iii) scent, (iv) taste, and 
touch (which includes the element of (v) extension, (vi) heat, (vii) and 
motion), and the five <i>pasāda rūpas</i> belong to the gross group. The 
remaining 16 which will be described in the chapter on <i>rūpa,</i> belong to 
the subtle group. They are termed subtle as there is no collision on their part. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>69.</b> Namely, all the 89 types of consciousness. They are sometimes 
collectively treated as one object as they all possess the identical 
characteristic of awareness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>70.</b> Namely, the 52 mental properties. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>71.</b> This is a supramundane object which is perceived by the eight 
kinds of Supramundane consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>72. Paññatti</b> is that which is made manifest. It is twofold-namely, <i>
nāma paññatti</i> and <i>attha paññatti.</i> The former means a name or term 
such as chair, table, etc., the latter means the object or idea conveyed 
thereby. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>73.</b> What is time? Strictly speaking, it is a mere concept which does 
not exist in an absolute sense. On the other hand what space is to matter, time 
is to mind. Conventionally we speak of past <i>(atīta),</i> present<i> 
(paccuppanna), </i>and future <i>(anāgata). </i></p>

<p>Past is defined as that which has gone beyond its own state or the moments of 
genesis, development, and cessation <i>(attano sabhāvam uppādādikkhanam vā atītā 
atikkantā atītā). </i></p>

<p>Present is that which on account of this and that reason enters, goes, exists 
above the moments of genesis etc. <i>(tam tam kāranam paticca uppādādikkhanam 
uddham pannā, gatā, pavattā = paccuppannā). </i></p>

<p>Future is that which has not yet reached both states <i>(tadubhayam&#39; pi na 
āgatā sampattā). </i></p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma each consciousness consists of three phases - <i>
uppāda</i>
(genesis), <i>thiti</i> (development), and <i>bhanga</i> (dissolution or 
cessation). In the view of some commentators there is no intermediate <i>thiti</i> 
stage but only the stages of arising and passing away. Each thought-moment is 
followed by another. Time is thus the <i>sine qua non</i> of the succession of 
mental states. The fundamental unit of time is the duration of a thought-moment. 
Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleeting thought moments is such 
that within the brief duration of a flash of lightning there may be billions of 
thought-moments. </p>

<p>Matter, which also constantly changes, endures only for seventeen 
thought-moments, being the time duration for one thought-process. </p>

<p>Past is gone, Future has not come. We live only for one thought-moment and 
that slips into the irrevocable past. In one sense there is only the eternal 
NOW. In another sense the so-called present is the transitional stage from the 
future to the past.
</p>

<p>The Dictionary of Philosophy defines time &quot;as the general medium in which all 
events take place in succession or appear to take place in succession.&quot; </p>

<p>Atthasālini states that time is a concept derived from this or that 
phenomenon. And it does not exist in reality; it is merely a concept. <i>(Tam 
tam upādāya paññatto kālo nāma. So pan&#39; esa sabhāvato avaijjamānattā 
paññatti-mattako eva). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>74. </b>All sense-objects belong to the present. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>75. </b>Accordingly - <i>yathāraham,</i> i.e., with respect to 
sense-sphere Javana, Higher Intellect <i>(abhiññā) </i>and other Sublime 
Javanas. </p>

<p>The six kinds of objects of the Sense-sphere Javanas, with the exception of 
smiling consciousness, are present, past, future, and independent of time. </p>

<p>The objects of the smiling consciousness are past, present, and future.
</p>

<p>The objects of the Javanas, by means of which the Higher Intellect such as 
Divine Eye, Divine Ear are developed, are past, present, future, and independent 
of time. </p>

<p>The objects of sublime Javanas may be either timeless or past. </p>

<p>As Nibbāna is eternal it does not belong to the past, present, or future. It 
is timeless. So is <i>paññatti,</i> independent of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>76.</b> This difficult passage needs some explanation.</p>

<p>When a person is about to die he sometimes recollects a good or bad action he 
has performed during his lifetime. The moral or immoral consciousness, 
experienced at the particular moment, arises now as a fresh consciousness This 
is technically known as &#39;Kamma&#39;. </p>

<p>Being a thought, it is a <i>dhammārammana</i> grasped through the mind-door, 
and is past.</p>

<p>The object of the <i>patisandhi, bhavanga,</i> and <i>cuti</i> classes of 
consciousness of the subsequent life is this <i>dhammārammana</i>. </p>

<p>At times it may be a sign or symbol associated with the good or bad action. 
It may be one of the five physical objects viewed through one of the six doors, 
as a present or past object. </p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, one hears the Dhamma at the dying moment. In this case 
the present audible word grasped through the ear becomes the object. It, 
therefore, follows that the object of the afore-said three classes of 
consciousness of the following life becomes this <i>kamma nimitta. </i></p>

<p>Again, let us think that a dying physician sees through his mental eye the 
patients he has treated. Now this is a past <i>rūpārammana</i> perceived through 
the mind-door. </p>

<p>Or again, let us think that a dying butcher hears the groans of cattle he has 
killed. The past audible object is presented to the person through the 
mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Kamma-nimitta</b> may, therefore, be past or present, viewed through one 
of the six doors. In some cases some symbol of the place in which he is to be 
reborn such as fire, flesh, celestial mansions, etc. may appear to the dying 
person. This is regarded as present object grasped through the mind-door. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Gati-nimitta</b> is, therefore, a visual object, present in point of time, 
and is perceived through the mind-door. </p>

<p>It should be noted that the <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i>, and <i>cuti</i>
thought-moments of the Sense-sphere have for their objects a <i>kamma,</i> a <i>
kamma-nimitta,</i>
or a <i>gati-nimitta,</i> perceived through one of the six-doors, in the 
immediately preceding life. </p>

<p>In the case of all <i>rūpāvacara patisandhi</i> etc., the object is always a 
past <i>kamma-nimitta</i> which is a concept <i>(paññatti)</i> such as a <i>
kasina</i>
symbol, perceived through the mind door. </p>

<p>The object of the first and third <i>arūpa patisandhi</i> etc., is also a 
past concept <i>(paññatti)</i> such as <i>&#39;ananto ākāso&#39;</i> &#39;infinite is space&#39; 
in the case of the first, and the concept <i>&#39;natthi kiñci&#39;</i>-&#39;there is 
nothing,&#39; in the case of the third. These two concepts are regarded as <i>
kamma-nimittas</i>
perceived through the mind-door. </p>

<p>The object of the second and fourth <i>arūpa jhāna patisandhi</i>
etc., is a past mental object which serves as the <i>kamma-nimitta</i> perceived 
through the mind-door. </p>

<p>As was explained in the first chapter the second <i>arūpa</i>
consciousness was developed by taking the first <i>arūpa</i> consciousness as 
the object, and the fourth with the third as the object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>77.</b> The term <i>&#39;yebhuyyena&#39;</i> (mostly) is used to indicate the 
rebirth of one born in the <i>asañña</i> plane where there is no consciousness. 
The commentary states that by the power of Kamma some object such as a <i>
kamma-nimitta</i>
presents itself to the <i>patisandhi</i> consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>78. </b>In Buddhism an ordinary worldling is called a <i>puthujjana</i>
(lit., manyfolk or one who is born again and again). Those who have attained the 
first three stages of Sainthood are called <i>sekhas</i> (lit., those who 
undergo a training). Those who have attained the Final stage of Sainthood 
(Arahatship) are called <i>asekhas,</i>
who no more undergo any training. </p>

<p>The <b>sekhas</b> cannot comprehend the Path and Fruit consciousness of an 
Arahat because they have not attained that superior state, but worldly thoughts 
of an Arahat they can. </p>

<p>Similarly the worldlings cannot comprehend the supramundane consciousness of 
the <i>Sekha</i> Saints. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>79. Abhiññā</b> are the five kinds of Higher Knowledge. They are Divine 
Eye <i>(dibbacakkhu),</i> Divine Ear <i>(dibbasota), </i>Reminiscence of past 
births <i>(pubbenivāsānussati ñāna), </i>Reading the thoughts of others <i>
(paracittavijānana)
</i>and Psychic Powers <i>(iddhividha ñāna). </i>To develop these five <i>
abhiññas</i>
one must possess the fifth Jhāna. Not even with this developed Sublime 
consciousness can a worldling or a <i>Sekha</i> comprehend the Path and Fruit 
consciousness of an Arahat. </p>

<p>It is only an Arahat who can comprehend the Path and Fruit consciousness of 
an Arahat. </p>

<p>A detailed account of <i>abhiññā</i> will appear in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>80.</b> These two classes of consciousness are experienced only by 
Arahats. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>81.</b> This is the <i>manodvārāvajjana</i> which occurs before every 
Javana process. Hence there is nothing that is beyond the scope of this 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>82.</b> Namely, Sense-sphere objects, Sublime objects, Supramundane 
objects, and concepts <i>(paññatti). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>83.</b> The object of the second <i>arūpa</i> consciousness is the first <i>
arūpa</i> consciousness, while that of the fourth is the third. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>84. </b>i.e., the object of the first <i>arūpa</i> consciousness is the 
concept <i>&#39;ananto ākāso&#39;</i> &#39;infinite is space,&#39; that of the third is the 
concept <i>&#39;natthi kiñci&#39;</i> there is nothing.&#39; </p>

<p>An explanation of these appears in the first chapter, </p>

<p>All the <i>rūpa jhānas</i> have concepts such as <i>kasinas</i> as their 
objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>85.</b> Namely, 23 Sense-sphere Resultants + 1 sense-door consciousness + 
1 smiling consciousness = 25. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>86. Paritta,</b> derived from <i>pari +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>dā,</i> to break, to shorten, means lower or inferior. This refers to 
Sense-sphere objects. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>87.</b> Namely, the Moral, Resultant, and Functional 2nd and 4th <i>arūpa 
cittas</i> <i>(viññānāñcāyatana </i>and <i>n&#39;eva saññā n&#39;āsaññāyatana). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>88.</b> Namely, 16 <i>rūpa jhānas</i> and Moral, Resultant, and Functional 
1st and 3rd <i>arūpa jhānas (ākāsānañcāyatana</i> and <i>ākiñcaññāyatana);</i>
15 + 6 = 21.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>89. Vohāra </b>here refers to concepts such as <i>kasinas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>90.</b> Namely, the 12 Immorals and 8 Sense-sphere Morals and Functionals, 
dissociated with knowledge. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>91.</b> They are the 4 Sense-sphere Morals associated with knowledge and 
the 5th Moral <i>rūpa jhāna (abhiññā kusala citta). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>92.</b> They are the 4 Sense-sphere Functionals, 5th Functional <i>rūpa

<p>(vi. Summary of Bases)</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 12. In the summary of bases (93), there are six kinds-namely, eye, ear, 
nose, tongue, body, and heart. </p>

<p>All these, too, (94) are found in the Sense-sphere. But in the Form-sphere 
three bases - nose, tongue, and body - are not found (96). In the 
Formless-sphere no base (96) exists. </p>

<p>Therein the five elements of sense-impressions lie entirely dependent on the 
five sensory parts (97) of the organs as their respective bases. But the 
mind-element - namely, the five-door adverting consciousness and the (two types 
of) receiving consciousness - rest in dependence on the heart (98). Likewise the 
remaining mind-conscious-element (99) comprising the (100) investigating 
consciousness, the great Resultants, the two (101) accompanied by aversion, the 
first Path (192) consciousness, smiling consciousness (103), and Form-sphere 
(104) consciousness, rest in dependence on the heart (105). </p>

<p>(10 + 3 + 3 + 8 +2 + 1 + 1 + 15 = 43)</p>

<p>The remaining classes of consciousness (106) whether Moral, Immoral, 
Functional, or Supramundane, are either dependent on, or independent of, the 
heart-base. The Formless-sphere Resultants are independent of the heart-base. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 13. It should be known that in the Sense-sphere seven elements (107) are 
dependent on the six bases, in the Form sphere four (108) are dependent on three 
(109) bases, in the Formless-sphere the one single (110) mind-element is not</p>

<p>dependent on any.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forty-three arise dependent on a base. Forty-two arise with or without a 
base. The formless Resultants arise without any base. </p>

<p>Thus ends the third chapter in the compendium of Abhidhamma, entitled the 
Miscellaneous Treatment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notes:-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>93. Vatthu </b>is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vas,</i>
to dwell. In its primary sense it means a garden, field, or avenue. In its 
secondary sense it means a cause or condition. <i>Vatthu</i> is also applied to 
something that exists, that is, a substance, object, or thing. Referring to the 
three objects of worship, the Buddha says <i>&quot;Uddesikam ti avatthukam.&quot;</i> Here <i>
avatthuka</i> means objectless, without a thing or substance. </p>

<p>Vatthu is the seat of sense-organs. </p>

<p>There are six seats of physical bases corresponding to the six senses. </p>

<p>These will be fully described in the chapter on <i>rūpa.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>94.</b> The indeclinable particle <i>&#39;pi&#39;</i> (too) in the text indicates 
that there is an exception in the case of those who are born blind, deaf, dumb, 
etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>95.</b> The organs exist, but not their sensory faculties as beings in 
these higher planes have temporarily inhibited the desire for sensual pleasures <i>
(kāmarāga).</i>
They possess eye and ear so that they may utilize them for good purposes. The 
heart-base also exists because it is the seat of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>96.</b> Being devoid of all forms of matter. Mind alone exists even 
without the seat of consciousness by the power of meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>97. </b>For instance, the eye-consciousness depends on the sensory surface 
of the eye but not on the physical organ or &#39;eye of flesh.&#39; The other 
sense-impressions also depend on their respective sensory surfaces. </p>

<p>The sensory surfaces <i>(pasāda)</i> of these five organs should be 
understood as follows: -</p>

<p><b>&quot;Cakkhu&quot;</b> which stands for vision, sense of sight and eye. &quot;Eye,&quot; 
however, is always in the present work to be understood as the seeing faculty or 
visual sense, and not as the physical or &#39;eye of flesh&#39; <i>(mamsa cakkhu).</i> 
The commentary gives an account of the eye, of which the following is the 
substance: First the aggregate organism <i>(sasambhāra-cakkhu):</i> a ball of 
flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by the socket bone beneath and by the bone of the 
eyebrow above, by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within and by 
the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, the 
six attributes dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form <i>
(santhānam),</i> and collocation <i>(sambhavo);
</i>vitality, sex, body-sensibility <i>(kāyappasādo),</i> and the visual 
sentient organ. The last four have their source in kamma. When &#39;the world, 
seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it only 
perceives the basis (or seat-<i>vatthu)</i>
of the eye. And this ball of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibers, is 
white, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent and the 
gaseous. It is white by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red 
by superfluity of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by 
superfluity of the liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent, quivering by 
superfluity of the gaseous. But that sentient organ <i>(pasādo)</i>
which is there bound, inherent, derived from the four great principles - this is 
the visual sense <i>(pasāda-cakkhu).</i> Placed in the midst and in the front of 
the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding it (note that 
the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the &#39;black disc&#39;) and in the 
circle of vision, in the region where the forms of adjacent bodies come to 
appear, it permeates the seven ocular membranes as sprinkled oil will permeate 
seven cotton wicks. And so it stands, aided by the four elements, sustaining, 
maturing, moving (samudīranam) - like an infant prince and four nurses, feeding, 
bathing, dressing, and fanning him - maintained by nutriment both physical <i>
(utu)</i> and mental, protected by the (normal) span of life, invested with 
colour, smell, taste, and so forth, in size the measure of a louse&#39;s head - 
stands duly constituting itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions etc. 
For as it has been said by the Commander of the Doctrine (Sāriputta): </p>

<p>&#39;The visual sense by which he beholds forms</p>

<p>Is small and delicate, comparable to a louse&#39;s head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b></p>

<p>Sotappasāda -</b></p>

<p>&quot;This, situated within the cavity of the aggregate organism of the ear, and 
well-furnished fine reddish hairs, is in shape like a little finger-stall <i>
(angulivethana).&quot;</i>

<p>Kāyappasāda -</b></p>

<p>&quot;The sphere of kāya - so runs the comment (Asl. 311) - is diffused over the 
whole bodily form just as oil pervades an entire cotton rag.&quot; </p>

<p><b>98. Hadayavatthu </b>- heart-base. </p>

<p>According to the commentators, <i>hadayavatthu</i> is the seat of 
consciousness. Tradition says that within the cavity of the heart there is some 
blood, and depending on which lies the seat of consciousness. It was this 
cardiac theory that prevailed in the Buddha&#39;s time, and this was evidently 
supported by the Upanishads. </p>

<p>The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit 
Himself. </p>

<p>Mr. Aung in his Compendium argues that the Buddha was silent on this point. 
He did not positively assert that the seat of consciousness was either in the 
heart or in the brain. In the Dhammasangani the term <i>hadayavatthu</i> has 
purposely been omitted. In the Patthāna, instead of using hadaya as the seat of 
consciousness, the Buddha has simply stated <i>&#39;yam rūpain nissāya&#39;</i> - 
&#39;depending on that <i>rūpa.&#39;</i>
Mr. Aung&#39;s opinion is that the Buddha did not want to reject the popular theory. 
Nor did He advance a new theory that brain is the seat of consciousness as is 
regarded by modern scientists. </p>

<p><b>99. Dhātu</b> is derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dhar,</i>
to hold, to bear. &#39;That which carries its own characteristic mark is <i>dhātu.</i> 
They are so called since they are devoid of being or life <i>(nissatta nijjīva). </i></p>

<p>For the sake of convenience three technical terms are used here. They are <i>
pañca-viññāna-dhātu, manodhātu, mano-viññāna-dhātu.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Pañca-viññāna-dhātu</i> is applied to the ten sense-impressions. </p>

<p><i>Mano-dhātu </i>- is applied to the two types of receiving consciousness 
and five-door adverting consciousness<i> (sampaticchana</i> and <i>
pañcadvārāvajjana).</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mano-viññāna-dhātu</i> is applied to all the remaining classes of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>100. </b>The three classes of investigating consciousness and the eight 
great Resultants do not arise in the Formless sphere owing to the absence of any 
door or any function there. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>101.</b> As aversion has been inhibited by, those born in <i>rūpa</i>
and <i>arūpa</i> planes the two classes of consciousness, accompanied by 
aversion, do not arise there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>102.</b> To attain the first stage of Sainthood one must hear the word 
from another <i>(paratoghosappaccaya). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>103.</b> Smiling consciousness cannot arise without a body. Buddhas and 
Pacceka Buddhas who experience such classes of consciousness are not born 
outside the human plane. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>104.</b> No <i>rūpa jhāna</i> consciousness arises in the <i>arūpaloka</i>
as those persons born in such planes have temporarily inhibited the desire for <i>
rūpa.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>105. </b>All the 43 types of consciousness, stated above, are dependent on 
the <i>hadayavatthu. </i></p>

<p>(10 + 3 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 15 = 43) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>106.</b> They are the 8 <i>sobhana kusalas,</i> 4 <i>rūpa kusalas,</i>
10 <i>akusalas,</i> 1 <i>manodvārāvajjana,</i> 8 <i>sobhana kriyā,</i> 4 <i>
arūpa kriyā,</i> 7 <i>lokuttaras</i> = 42. </p>

<p>These may arise in planes with the five Aggregates or in planes with four 
Aggregates <i>(arūpa-loka). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>107.</b> i.e., 5 <i>pañca-viññāna-dhātus</i> + 1 <i>manodhātu</i>
+ 1 <i>mano-viññāna-dhātu</i> = 7. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>108.</b> i.e., 1 <i>cakkhu-viññāna,</i> 1 <i>sota-viññāna</i>, 1 <i>
mano-dhātu,</i> 1 <i>mano-viññāna-dhātu</i> = 4. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>109.</b> Namely, <i>cakkhu, sota</i> and <i>hadayavatthu. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>110.</b> Dhātu + eka = Dhātv&#39; eka. This refers to <i>mano-viññāna-dhātu.</i>
