<h4>Notes - </h4>

<p><a name='2-42' href='?#2-42'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-43' href='?#2-43'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Vedanā</b> is a significant mental state which is common to all types 
of consciousness. Feeling is its characteristic <i>(vedayita-lakkhana), </i>and 
is born of contact. Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering for <i>
vedanā. </i></p>

<p><a name='2-44' href='?#2-44'>&nbsp;</a>Feeling is defined as: &quot;a conscious, subjective impression which does not 
involve cognition or representation of an object.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p><a name='2-45' href='?#2-45'>&nbsp;</a>Sensation is explained as: &quot;the content of sensuous intuition, or the way in 
which a conscious subject is modified by the presence of an object.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='2-46' href='?#2-46'>&nbsp;</a><i>Vedanā</i> modifies the stream of consciousness and serves both as a 
life-promoting and life-destroying force. Pleasure, for example, promotes life; 
pain impairs it. As such feeling plays a very important part in the life of man. </p>

<p><a name='2-47' href='?#2-47'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-48' href='?#2-48'>&nbsp;</a>Experiencing the taste of an object is the function of <i>vedanā (anubhavana 
rasa).</i> Particular likes and dislikes depend on the desirability and the 
undesirability of the external object. Generally they are mechanistic. </p>

<p><a name='2-49' href='?#2-49'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-50' href='?#2-50'>&nbsp;</a>Sometimes the freewill of a person determines the mode of feeling independent 
of the nature of the object. The sight of an enemy, for example, would normally 
be a source of displeasure, but a right-understanding person would, on the 
contrary, extend his loving-kindness towards him and experience some kind of 
pleasure. Socrates, for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and faced a 
happy death. Once a certain Brahman poured a torrent of abuse on the Buddha, but 
He kept smiling and returned love unto him. The ascetic Khantivādi, who was 
brutally tortured by a drunkard king, wished him long life instead of cursing 
him. </p>

<p><a name='2-51' href='?#2-51'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-52' href='?#2-52'>&nbsp;</a>A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the other hand, may even, at the sight of a 
Buddha, harbour a thought of hatred. His feeling will be one of displeasure. 
Likewise a similar feeling may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhist at the 
sight of a religious teacher of an alien faith. What is meat and drink to one, 
may be poison to another. </p>

<p><a name='2-53' href='?#2-53'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-54' href='?#2-54'>&nbsp;</a>Material pleasures, for instance, would be highly prized by an average 
person. An understanding recluse would find happiness in renouncing them and 
leading a life of voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a solitary life, a 
sensualist may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven to one may be hell to another; 
what is hell to one may be heaven to another. We ourselves create them, and they 
are more or less mind-made. </p>

<p><a name='2-55' href='?#2-55'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-56' href='?#2-56'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;There are, o Bhikkhus, two kinds of feeling-pain and happiness&quot;, says the 
Buddha. Well, then, how can there be a third which is neither pain nor 
happiness? The commentary states that blameless neutral feeling is included in 
happiness and the blameworthy in pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-57' href='?#2-57'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-58' href='?#2-58'>&nbsp;</a>Again, the Buddha has stated that whatever is felt in this world, all that is 
pain. It is because of the changeable nature of all conditioned things. </p>

<p><a name='2-59' href='?#2-59'>&nbsp;</a>From another standpoint considering all forms of feeling as purely mental, 
there are only three kinds - namely, happiness <i>(sukha),</i> pain <i>(dukkha), </i>
and neutral <i>(adukkhamasukha). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-60' href='?#2-60'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-61' href='?#2-61'>&nbsp;</a>Atthasālini explains them, as follows:-</p>

<p><a name='2-62' href='?#2-62'>&nbsp;</a>The term <i>sukha</i> means &#39;pleasurable feeling&#39; <i>(sukha-vedanā), </i>
&#39;root of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-mūla),</i> &#39;pleasurable object&#39; <i>(sukhārammana),</i> 
&#39;cause of happiness&#39; <i>(sukha-hetu),</i> &#39;conditioning state of pleasure, <i>
(sukha-paccayatthāna),</i>
free from troubles&#39; <i>(abyāpajjhā),</i> &#39;Nibbāna&#39;, etc.</p>

<p><a name='2-63' href='?#2-63'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-64' href='?#2-64'>&nbsp;</a>In the expression: &quot;By eliminating <i>sukha</i>&quot; - <i>sukha</i>
means pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-65' href='?#2-65'>&nbsp;</a>In the expression: &quot;<i>Sukha</i> is non-attachment in this world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means root of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-66' href='?#2-66'>&nbsp;</a>In the expression: &quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>sukha,</i> falls and descends 
on sukha&quot;. Here <i>sukha</i> means object of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-67' href='?#2-67'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Merit, o Bhikkhus, is a synonym for <i>sukha</i>.&quot; Here <i>sukha</i>
means cause of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-68' href='?#2-68'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Not easy is it, o Bhikkhus, to attain to heavenly <i>sukha</i> by 
description&quot;. &quot;They know not <i>sukha</i> who do not see <i>nandana</i>&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means conditioning state of pleasure. </p>

<p><a name='2-69' href='?#2-69'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;These states constitute a <i>sukha</i> life in this very world&quot;. Here <i>
sukha</i> means freedom from troubles.</p>

<p><a name='2-70' href='?#2-70'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Nibbāna is supreme <i>sukha&#39;&#39;.</i> Here <i>sukha</i> means Nibbāna. </p>

<p><a name='2-71' href='?#2-71'>&nbsp;</a>From these quotations the reader can understand in what different senses the 
term <i>sukha</i> is used in the texts. In this particular connection the term <i>
sukha</i>
is used in the sense of pleasurable feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-72' href='?#2-72'>&nbsp;</a>Nibbāna is stated to be supreme bliss <i>(sukha). </i>This does not mean that 
there is a pleasurable feeling in Nibbāna although the term <i>sukha</i> is 
used. Nibbāna is a bliss of relief. The release from suffering is itself 
Nibbānic bliss.
</p>

<p><a name='2-73' href='?#2-73'>&nbsp;</a>The term <i>dukkha</i> means &#39;painful feeling&#39;, &#39;basis of pain&#39;, object of 
pain&#39;, cause of pain&#39;, &#39;conditioning state of pain&#39;, etc. </p>

<p><a name='2-74' href='?#2-74'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;&#39;By eliminating <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means painful feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-75' href='?#2-75'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Birth too is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means basis of pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-76' href='?#2-76'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Since, o Mahāli, form is <i>dukkha</i>, falls and descends on pain&quot; - here <i>
dukkha</i> means object of <i>dukkha. </i></p>

<p><a name='2-77' href='?#2-77'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Accumulation of evil is <i>dukkha</i>&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i>
means cause of pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-78' href='?#2-78'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;It is not easy, o Bhikkhus, to realize the pain of woeful states by 
description&quot; - here <i>dukkha</i> means &quot;conditioning states of pain.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='2-79' href='?#2-79'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-80' href='?#2-80'>&nbsp;</a>In this particular connection the term <i>dukkha</i> is used in the sense of 
painful feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-81' href='?#2-81'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-82' href='?#2-82'>&nbsp;</a>In the Dhammacakka Sutta the Buddha enumerates eight divisions of <i>dukkha
</i>-namely: </p>

<p><a name='2-83' href='?#2-83'>&nbsp;</a>1. Birth is suffering, 2. decay is suffering, 3. disease is suffering, 4. 
death is suffering, 5. association with the unpleasant is suffering, 6. 
separation from the beloved is suffering, 7. when one does not obtain what one 
desires there is suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering. </p>

<p><a name='2-84' href='?#2-84'>&nbsp;</a>All these are the causes of <i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='2-85' href='?#2-85'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-86' href='?#2-86'>&nbsp;</a>When the Buddha addresses Devas and men He speaks of eight kinds of <i>
dukkha.</i>
When He addresses only men He speaks of twelve. Instead of <i>vyādhi</i> 
(disease) He says <i>soka</i> (grief), <i>parideva</i> (lamentation), <i>dukkha</i> 
(pain), <i>domanassa</i>
(displeasure) <i>upāyāsa</i> (despair) are suffering. All these five are 
included in <i>vyādhi</i>
which embraces both physical and mental disharmony. </p>

<p><a name='2-87' href='?#2-87'>&nbsp;</a><i>Soka, domanassa,</i> and <i>upāyāsa</i> are mental, while <i>dukkha</i>
and <i>parideva</i> are physical. </p>

<p><a name='2-88' href='?#2-88'>&nbsp;</a>Practically there is no marked difference between the two formulas. </p>

<p><a name='2-89' href='?#2-89'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-90' href='?#2-90'>&nbsp;</a><b>Adukkha-m-asukha</b> is that which is neither pain nor happiness. It is a 
neutral feeling. This corresponds to both stolid indifference and Stoic 
indifference. The Pāli term <i>upekkhā,</i> which has a wider connotation, is 
more frequently used to denote this kind of neutral feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-91' href='?#2-91'>&nbsp;</a>In an immoral type of consciousness <i>upekkhā</i> assumes the role of stolid 
indifference because it is prompted by ignorance. In an <i>ahetuka</i> resultant 
consciousness, such as a sense-impression, <i>upekkhā</i> means simple neutral 
feeling which has no ethical value. <i>Adukkha-m-asukha</i> strictly applies in 
this connection. <i>Upekkhā</i>
latent in a <i>kāmāvacara sobhana citta</i> (Beautiful type of consciousness 
pertaining to the Sense-sphere) may be any of the following states - simple 
indifference (not stolid because there is no ignorance), simple neutral feeling, 
disinterestedness, unbiased feeling, Stoic indifference, and perfect equanimity. </p>

<p><a name='2-92' href='?#2-92'>&nbsp;</a><i>Upekkhā</i> in the <i>jhāna</i> consciousness is perfect equanimity born 
of concentration. It is both ethical and intellectual. </p>

<p><a name='2-93' href='?#2-93'>&nbsp;</a>See Ch. 1, Note 42. </p>

<p><a name='2-94' href='?#2-94'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-95' href='?#2-95'>&nbsp;</a>According to a still wider classification <i>vedanā</i> is fivefold namely. </p>

    <p><a name='2-96' href='?#2-96'>&nbsp;</a>(i ) <i>sukha</i> (physical happiness),</p>

<p><a name='2-102' href='?#2-102'>&nbsp;</a>All feelings, from an ultimate standpoint, are mental because <i>vedanā</i>
is a <i>cetasikā.</i> But a differentiation has been made with regard to <i>
sukha</i> and
<i>dukkha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='2-103' href='?#2-103'>&nbsp;</a>Of all the 89 types of consciousness only two are associated with either <i>
sukha</i> or <i>dukkha.</i> One is the body-consciousness associated with 
happiness, and the other is body-consciousness associated with pain. </p>

<p><a name='2-104' href='?#2-104'>&nbsp;</a>Both these are the resultant types of consciousness, effects of good and evil 
Kamma.</p>

<p><a name='2-105' href='?#2-105'>&nbsp;</a>A soft touch, for instance, yields happiness. A pinprick, on the contrary, 
yields pain. In these cases one experiences the aforesaid two types of 
consciousness respectively. </p>

<p><a name='2-106' href='?#2-106'>&nbsp;</a>Now a question arises - Why only the body-consciousness is associated with 
happiness and pain? Why not the other sense-impressions? </p>

<p><a name='2-107' href='?#2-107'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-108' href='?#2-108'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Aung provides an answer in his introductory essay to the Compendium: -</p>

<p><a name='2-109' href='?#2-109'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;The sense of touch alone is accompanied by the positive hedonic elements of 
pain and pleasure; the other four senses are accompanied by hedonic 
indifference. This exceptional distinction is assigned to the sense of touch, 
because the impact between the sentient surface <i>(pasāda rūpa) </i>and the 
respective objects of other senses, both sets of which are secondary qualities 
of body, is not strong enough to produce physical pain or pleasure. But in the 
case of touch there is contact with one or other, or all the three primary 
qualities (locality - <i>pathavī,</i> temperature - <i>tejo,</i>
pressure - <i>vāyo)</i> and this is strong enough to affect those primary 
qualities in the percipient&#39;s own body. Just as cotton wool on the anvil does 
not affect the latter, but a hammer striking cotton wool imparts its check to 
the anvil also.&#39;&#39; </p>

<p><a name='2-110' href='?#2-110'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-111' href='?#2-111'>&nbsp;</a>(Compendium of Philosophy p. 14). </p>

<p><a name='2-112' href='?#2-112'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-113' href='?#2-113'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of touch the impact is strong. The &quot;essentials&quot;, <i>pathavī, tejo</i> 
and <i>vāyo</i> (extension, heat, and motion) - <i>āpo,</i> cohesion, is 
excluded being intangible - forcibly and directly strike against the essentials 
of the body. Consequently there is either pain or happiness. In the case of 
seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting, there is a bare impact. The consequent 
feeling is neither pain nor happiness. </p>

<p><a name='2-114' href='?#2-114'>&nbsp;</a>Although these sense-impressions may be <i>sukha, dukkha,</i> or <i>upekkhā</i>
the <i>javana</i> thought processes conditioned thereby may not necessarily be 
associated with a similar feeling. </p>

<p><a name='2-115' href='?#2-115'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-116' href='?#2-116'>&nbsp;</a>For instance, the Buddha experienced a body-consciousness associated with 
pain when a rock splinter struck His foot, but His <i>javana</i> thought-process 
conditioned thereby would not necessarily be associate with displeasure. 
Unaffected by the pain, He would have experienced perfect equanimity. The 
immanent feeling in the stream of consciousness would have been <i>upekkhā.</i> 
Similarly at the sight of the Buddha, a right-understanding person would 
automatically experience an eye-consciousness associated with indifference <i>
(upekkhā-sahagata cakkhu-viññāna)</i> but his <i>javana</i>
thought would be moral. The innate feeling would be pleasure <i>(somanassa). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-117' href='?#2-117'>&nbsp;</a>This intricate point should be clearly understood. </p>

<p><a name='2-118' href='?#2-118'>&nbsp;</a><i>Somanassa</i> (good-mindedness ) and <i>domanassa</i>
(bad-mindedness) are purely mental. </p>

<p><a name='2-119' href='?#2-119'>&nbsp;</a>These five kinds of feeling could be reduced to three, the three to two, and 
the two to one as follows:-</p>

<p><a name='2-126' href='?#2-126'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Sukha</b> - physical happiness should be differentiated from <i>
somanassa</i>
- mental pleasure. So should <i>dukkha</i> - physical pain - be differentiated 
from <i>domanassa</i>
- mental displeasure. There is only one consciousness accompanied by <i>sukha.</i>
Similarly there is only one accompanied by <i>dukkha.</i> Both of them are the 
effects of good and bad actions respectively. </p>

<p><a name='2-127' href='?#2-127'>&nbsp;</a>When the Buddha, for instance, was injured by Devadatta Thera, He experienced 
a body-consciousness accompanied by pain. This was the result of a past evil 
action of His. When we sit on a comfortable seat we experience a body 
consciousness accompanied by happiness. This is the result of a past good 
action. All forms of physical pain and happiness are the inevitable results of 
our own Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='2-128' href='?#2-128'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='2-129' href='?#2-129'>&nbsp;</a>5. Readers will note that pleasurable types of consciousness exceed all 
others. As such during a life-time a person experiences more happy moments than 
painful ones. This does not contradict the statement that life is sorrow <i>
(dukkha). </i>Here <i>dukkha</i>
is not used in the sense of painful feeling but in the sense of oppression or 
impeding <i>(pīlana).
</i>A careful reading of the description of <i>dukkha,</i> given in the 
Dhammacakka Sutta will make the matter clear. </p>

  <p><a name='2-168' href='?#2-168'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;The four Great Essentials <i>(Mahābhūta),</i> o Bhikkhus, are the causes<i>

  <p><a name='2-169' href='?#2-169'>&nbsp;</a>Here <i>hetu</i> is used in the sense of causal relation <i>(paccaya-hetu).
  </p>
  <p><a name='2-170' href='?#2-170'>&nbsp;</a></i>There is a subtle distinction between <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya.</i>
  The former signifies root <i>(mūla);</i> the latter, an aiding factor <i>
  (upakāraka dhamma).</i> <i>Hetu</i> is compared to the roots of a tree, and <i>
  paccaya</i> to manure, water and soil that aid its growth. </p>
  <p><a name='2-171' href='?#2-171'>&nbsp;</a>This distinction should be clearly understood. </p>
  <p><a name='2-172' href='?#2-172'>&nbsp;</a>It should also be noted that at times both <i>hetu</i> and <i>paccaya</i>

  volitional activities <i>(sankhārā). </p>
  <p><a name='2-177' href='?#2-177'>&nbsp;</a></i>Here <i>hetu</i> is used as the general cause. Just as the essence of 
  both earth and water is the common cause of both sweetness and bitterness, 
  even so ignorance is the common cause of volitional activities. </p>
  <p><a name='2-178' href='?#2-178'>&nbsp;</a>Though <i>hetu</i> assumes different shades of meaning in the Text, in this 
  particular instance it is used in the specific sense of root. </p>

<p><a name='2-180' href='?#2-180'>&nbsp;</a>10. All the <i>ahetuka cittas</i> are devoid of all roots. Hence they are 
neither moral nor immoral. They are regarded as unmoral. </p>

<p><a name='2-181' href='?#2-181'>&nbsp;</a>Seven of them are the resultants of immoral actions, eight of moral actions,

the other accompanied by restlessness <i>(uddhacca).</i> These are the only two 
types of consciousness that have one root, which is delusion. Being potentially 
weak, restlessness is powerless in determining a future birth. Both doubt and 
restlessness are regarded as two Fetters, the first of which is eradicated by 
the First Path, and the second by the Fourth Path of Sainthood. </p>

<p><a name='2-187' href='?#2-187'>&nbsp;</a>13. The first eight immoral types of consciousness are connected with <i>
lobha</i>

<p><a name='2-194' href='?#2-194'>&nbsp;</a>It should not be understood that evil thoughts conditioned by immoral roots 
do not arise in the <i>rūpaloka</i> and the <i>arūpaloka.</i> The point here

<p><a name='2-280' href='?#2-280'>&nbsp;</a>The type of consciousness one experiences at the moment of conception is 
termed <i>patisandhi citta.</i> It is so called because it links the past with 
the present. </p>

<p><a name='2-281' href='?#2-281'>&nbsp;</a>This <i>patisandhi citta,</i> also termed &#39;rebirth-consciousness,&#39; is 
conditioned by the powerful thought one experiences at the dying moment, and is 
regarded as the source of the present life-stream. In the course of one 
particular life there is only one <i>patisandhi citta.</i> The mental contents 
of <i>bhavanga,</i> which later arises an infinite number of times during one&#39;s 
lifetime, and of <i>cuti,</i> which arises only once at the final moment of 
death, are identical with those of <i>patisandhi. </i></p>

cause or condition of existence. </p>

<p><a name='2-285' href='?#2-285'>&nbsp;</a>One experiences only one thought-moment at any particular time. No two 
thought-moments coexist. </p>

<p><a name='2-286' href='?#2-286'>&nbsp;</a>Each thought-moment hangs on to some kind of object. No consciousness arises 
without an object, either mental or physical. </p>

<p><a name='2-287' href='?#2-287'>&nbsp;</a>When a person is fast asleep and is in a dreamless state he experiences a 
kind of consciousness which is more passive than active. It is similar to the 
consciousness one experiences at the initial moment of conception and at the 
final moment of death. This type of consciousness is in Abhidhamma termed <i>
bhavanga.</i> Like any other consciousness it also consists of three aspects - 
genesis <i>(uppāda),</i> static <i>(thiti)</i>
and cessation <i>(bhanga).</i> Arising and perishing every moment it flows on 
like a stream not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. </p>

<p><a name='2-288' href='?#2-288'>&nbsp;</a>When an object enters this stream through the sense-doors, the <i>bhavanga</i>
consciousness is arrested and another type of consciousness appropriate to the 
object perceived arises. Not only in a dreamless state but also in our waking 
state we experience
<i>bhavanga</i> thought-moments more than any other types of consciousness. 
Hence <i>bhavanga</i>
becomes an indispensable condition of life. </p>

<p><a name='2-289' href='?#2-289'>&nbsp;</a>Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. Aung compare <i>bhavanga</i> to &quot;Leibniz&#39;s state of 
obscure perception, not amounting to consciousness, in dreamless sleep.</p>

<p><a name='2-290' href='?#2-290'>&nbsp;</a>One cannot agree because <i>bhavanga</i> is a type of consciousness. There is 
no obscure perception here. </p>

<p><a name='2-291' href='?#2-291'>&nbsp;</a>Some identify <i>bhavanga</i> with sub-consciousness. According to the 
Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousness is &#39;&#39;a compartment of the mind 
alleged by certain psychologists and philosophers to exist below the threshold 
of consciousness.&quot; In the opinion of Western philosophers sub-consciousness and 
consciousness coexist. According to Abhidhamma no two types of consciousness 
coexist. Nor is <i>bhavanga</i> a sub-plane.</p>

<p><a name='2-292' href='?#2-292'>&nbsp;</a>The Compendium further states that &quot;bhavanga denotes a functional state (or 
moment ) of sub-consciousness. As such it is the sub-conscious state of mind - 
&#39;below the threshold&#39; of consciousness - by which we conceive continuous 
subjective existence as possible. Thus it corresponds to F. W. Myer&#39;s 
&#39;subliminal consciousness&#39;&quot;.(<font SIZE="2"> p.266)</font></p>

<p><a name='2-293' href='?#2-293'>&nbsp;</a>The Dictionary of Philosophy explains &#39;&#39;subliminal (sub, under + limen, the 
threshold) as allegedly unconscious mental processes especially sensations which 
lie below the threshold of consciousness.&quot; Strictly speaking, it does not 
correspond to subliminal consciousness either.</p>

<p><a name='2-294' href='?#2-294'>&nbsp;</a>There does not seem to be any place for <i>bhavanga</i> in Western 
Psychology.</p>

<p><a name='2-295' href='?#2-295'>&nbsp;</a><i>Bhavanga</i> is so called because it is an essential condition for 
continued subjective existence. </p>

<p><a name='2-296' href='?#2-296'>&nbsp;</a>Whenever the mind does not receive a fresh external object, one experiences a <i>
bhavanga</i> consciousness.* Immediately after a thought-process, too, there is 
a <i>bhavanga</i> consciousness. Hence it is called <i>vīthimutta</i> - 
process-freed. Sometimes it acts as a buffer between two thought-processes . </p>

(arresting <i>bhavanga).</i> Owing to the rapidity of the flow of <i>bhavanga</i> 
an external object does not immediately give rise to a thought-process. The 
original <i>bhavanga</i>
thought-moment perishes. Then the flow is checked. Before the actual transition 
of the <i>bhavanga</i>
it vibrates for one moment. When the <i>bhavanga</i> is arrested a 
thought-moment arises adverting the consciousness towards the object. If it is a 
physical object, the thought-moment is termed five-door cognition <i>

<p><a name='2-338' href='?#2-338'>&nbsp;</a>Here Javana means running. It is so called because in the course of a 
thought-process it runs consecutively for seven thought-moments or five, hanging 
on to an identical object. The mental states occurring in all these thought 
moments are similar, but the potential force differs.</p>

<p><a name='2-340' href='?#2-340'>&nbsp;</a>When the consciousness perceives a vivid object usually seven moments of 
Javana arise in the particular thought-process. In the case of death or when the 
Buddha performs the Twin Psychic Phenomenon <i>(Yamaka Pātihāriya)</i> only five 
thought moments arise. In the Supramundane Javana process the Path-consciousness 
arises only for one moment. </p>

<p><a name='2-341' href='?#2-341'>&nbsp;</a>This javana stage is the most important from a ethical standpoint. It is at 
this psychological stage that good or evil is actually done. Irrespective of the 
desirability or the undesirability of the object presented to the mind, one can 
make the Javana process good or bad. If, for instance, one meets an enemy, a 
thought of hatred will arise almost automatically. A wise and forbearing person 
might, on the contrary, harbour a thought of love towards him. This is the 
reason why the Buddha has stated in the Dhammapada (V. 165)</p>

(pertaining to the present life). </p>

<p><a name='2-497' href='?#2-497'>&nbsp;</a>It was stated earlier that <i>patisandhi,</i> <i>bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i>

identical although their functions differ. </p>

<p><a name='2-498' href='?#2-498'>&nbsp;</a>At the moment of death a thought-process that conditions the future existence 
occurs. The object of this thought-process may be (i) a Kamma (action) which one 
has performed in the course of one&#39;s life. One recollects the deed as if being 
renewed. Strictly speaking, it is a recurring of the consciousness which one has 
experienced while performing the action. Or it may be (ii) any symbol <i>
(kamma-nimitta) </i>which was conspicuous during the performance of the action. 
It may also be (iii) characteristic symbol of the place in which one is bound to 
be reborn<i> (gati nimitta)*</i>. Taking one of these three as the object, the 
rebirth-consciousness takes place in the future existence. The object of the <i>
bhavanga</i> and <i>cuti</i> of that particular existence is similar to that of 
the <i>patisandhi.</i> Hence it was stated above that they do not take any new 
external object. </p>

<p><a name='2-620' href='?#2-620'>&nbsp;</a><b>73.</b> What is time? Strictly speaking, it is a mere concept which does 
not exist in an absolute sense. On the other hand what space is to matter, time 
is to mind. Conventionally we speak of past <i>(atīta),</i> present<i> 
(paccuppanna), </i>and future <i>(anāgata). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-621' href='?#2-621'>&nbsp;</a>Past is defined as that which has gone beyond its own state or the moments of 
genesis, development, and cessation <i>(attano sabhāvam uppādādikkhanam vā atītā 
atikkantā atītā). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-622' href='?#2-622'>&nbsp;</a>Present is that which on account of this and that reason enters, goes, exists 
above the moments of genesis etc. <i>(tam tam kāranam paticca uppādādikkhanam 
uddham pannā, gatā, pavattā = paccuppannā). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-623' href='?#2-623'>&nbsp;</a>Future is that which has not yet reached both states <i>(tadubhayam&#39; pi na 
āgatā sampattā). </i></p>

<p><a name='2-624' href='?#2-624'>&nbsp;</a>According to Abhidhamma each consciousness consists of three phases - <i>
uppāda</i>
(genesis), <i>thiti</i> (development), and <i>bhanga</i> (dissolution or 
cessation). In the view of some commentators there is no intermediate <i>thiti</i> 
stage but only the stages of arising and passing away. Each thought-moment is 
followed by another. Time is thus the <i>sine qua non</i> of the succession of 
mental states. The fundamental unit of time is the duration of a thought-moment. 
Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleeting thought moments is such 
that within the brief duration of a flash of lightning there may be billions of 
thought-moments. </p>

<p><a name='2-625' href='?#2-625'>&nbsp;</a>Matter, which also constantly changes, endures only for seventeen 
thought-moments, being the time duration for one thought-process. </p>

<p><a name='2-626' href='?#2-626'>&nbsp;</a>Past is gone, Future has not come. We live only for one thought-moment and 
that slips into the irrevocable past. In one sense there is only the eternal 
NOW. In another sense the so-called present is the transitional stage from the 
future to the past.

events take place in succession or appear to take place in succession.&quot; </p>

phenomenon. And it does not exist in reality; it is merely a concept. <i>(Tam

<p><a name='2-644' href='?#2-644'>&nbsp;</a>Suppose, for instance, one hears the Dhamma at the dying moment. In this case

of the eye but not on the physical organ or &#39;eye of flesh.&#39; The other

<p><a name='2-737' href='?#2-737'>&nbsp;</a>The sensory surfaces <i>(pasāda)</i> of these five organs should be 
understood as follows: -</p>

<p><a name='2-738' href='?#2-738'>&nbsp;</a><b>&quot;Cakkhu&quot;</b> which stands for vision, sense of sight and eye. &quot;Eye,&quot; 
however, is always in the present work to be understood as the seeing faculty or 
visual sense, and not as the physical or &#39;eye of flesh&#39; <i>(mamsa cakkhu).</i> 
The commentary gives an account of the eye, of which the following is the 
substance: First the aggregate organism <i>(sasambhāra-cakkhu):</i> a ball of 
flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by the socket bone beneath and by the bone of the 
eyebrow above, by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within and by 
the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, the 
six attributes dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form <i>
(santhānam),</i> and collocation <i>(sambhavo);
</i>vitality, sex, body-sensibility <i>(kāyappasādo),</i> and the visual 
sentient organ. The last four have their source in kamma. When &#39;the world, 
seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it only 
perceives the basis (or seat-<i>vatthu)</i>
of the eye. And this ball of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibers, is 
white, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent and the 
gaseous. It is white by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red 
by superfluity of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by 
superfluity of the liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent, quivering by 
superfluity of the gaseous. But that sentient organ <i>(pasādo)</i>
which is there bound, inherent, derived from the four great principles - this is 
the visual sense <i>(pasāda-cakkhu).</i> Placed in the midst and in the front of 
the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding it (note that 
the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the &#39;black disc&#39;) and in the 
circle of vision, in the region where the forms of adjacent bodies come to 
appear, it permeates the seven ocular membranes as sprinkled oil will permeate 
seven cotton wicks. And so it stands, aided by the four elements, sustaining, 
maturing, moving (samudīranam) - like an infant prince and four nurses, feeding, 
bathing, dressing, and fanning him - maintained by nutriment both physical <i>
(utu)</i> and mental, protected by the (normal) span of life, invested with 
colour, smell, taste, and so forth, in size the measure of a louse&#39;s head - 
stands duly constituting itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions etc.

<p><a name='2-760' href='?#2-760'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentators, <i>hadayavatthu</i> is the seat of 
consciousness. Tradition says that within the cavity of the heart there is some 
blood, and depending on which lies the seat of consciousness. It was this 
cardiac theory that prevailed in the Buddha&#39;s time, and this was evidently 
supported by the Upanishads. </p>

<p><a name='2-761' href='?#2-761'>&nbsp;</a>The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit 
Himself. </p>

<p><a name='2-762' href='?#2-762'>&nbsp;</a>Mr. Aung in his Compendium argues that the Buddha was silent on this point. 
He did not positively assert that the seat of consciousness was either in the 
heart or in the brain. In the Dhammasangani the term <i>hadayavatthu</i> has 
purposely been omitted. In the Patthāna, instead of using hadaya as the seat of 
consciousness, the Buddha has simply stated <i>&#39;yam rūpain nissāya&#39;</i> - 
&#39;depending on that <i>rūpa.&#39;</i>
Mr. Aung&#39;s opinion is that the Buddha did not want to reject the popular theory. 
Nor did He advance a new theory that brain is the seat of consciousness as is 
regarded by modern scientists. </p>
