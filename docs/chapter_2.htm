<p><font FACE="Arial"><u><b>CHAPTER II - Mental States (c<i>etasika)</i></b></u></font></p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p>In the 89 types of consciousness, enumerated in the first chapter, 52 mental 
states arise in varying degree. </p>

<p>There are 7 concomitants common to every consciousness. There are 6 others 
that may or may not arise in each and every consciousness. They are termed <i>
Pakinnakā</i>
(Particulars). </p>

<p>All these 13 are designated <i>aññasamāna,</i> a rather peculiar technical 
term. <i>Añña</i> means &#39;other&#39;, <i>samana</i> means &#39;common&#39;. <i>Sobhanas,</i>
(Good), when compared with <i>asobhanas</i> (Evil,) are called <i>añña</i> - 
&#39;other&#39;, being of the opposite category. So are the <i>asobhanas</i> in 
contradistinction to <i>Sobhanas</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These 13 become moral or immoral according to the type of consciousness in 
which they occur. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>14 concomitants are variably found in every type of immoral 
	consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>19 are common to all types of moral consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 other moral concomitants occur as occasion arises. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus these fifty-two (7 + 6 + 14 + 19 + 6 = 52) are found in the respective 
types of consciousness in different proportions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this chapter all the 52 mental states are enumerated and classified. Every 
type of consciousness is microscopically analyzed, and the accompanying mental 
states are given in detail. The type of consciousness in which each mental state 
occurs, is also described. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To an impatient lay reader this chapter will appear rather dry and 
uninteresting. To a critical and intelligent reader it will, on the contrary, 
serve as an intellectual treat. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the outset, for instance, a student of chemistry may find the numerous 
chemical formulas somewhat perplexing. But he finds the subject interesting and 
edifying, when he seriously attempts to analyze and examine the various 
substances with different tests. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In like manner a student of Abhidhamma who reads this chapter should first 
try to analyze and examine care fully every type of consciousness and see for 
himself the mental states thereof according to his own reasoning. Later, he 
should compare his results with the original text. He will then find this 
chapter most illuminating, and instead of wasting time in memorizing numbers, he 
will intelligently grasp the meaning of the text. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, let us analyze the first immoral type of consciousness, rooted 
in attachment. </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><i>Somanassa-sahagata -</i> Accompanied by pleasure,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><i>Ditthigata-sampayutta -</i> Connected with misbelief,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><i>Asankhārika -</i> Unprompted. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>This consciousness, when analyzed, will show that the <i>vedanā</i> or 
feeling is pleasure&#39;. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 7 Universals and all the Particulars are found in it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 4 Immoral mental states common to all immorals such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p> <i>moha</i>
(delusion), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>ahirika</i> (shamelessness), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>anottappa,</i> (fearlessness),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>uddhacca</i> (restlessness) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>must arise in it. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the remaining ten? </p>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Lobha</i> - attachment must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Ditthi</i> - misbelief must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Māna</i> - conceit cannot arise. </dt>
    </div>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conceit does not arise in <i>lobha</i> consciousness, together with 
misbelief. <i>Ditthi</i> is connected with wrong view, while <i>māna</i> is 
concerned with egoism. Both of them, say the commentators, are like two lions 
that cannot live together in one cave. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><i>Dosa</i> (hatred), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>issā</i> (envy), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>macchariya</i> (avarice),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p> <i>kukkucca</i> (brooding) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>cannot arise, because these four are akin to aversion. They are found only in 
hateful consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> - (sloth and torpor) do not arise because this 
is an unprompted consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No <i>sobhanas</i> - (beautiful) occur in an immoral consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total - 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, on analysis, we see that the first immoral consciousness consists of 19 
mental states. </p>

<p>The other types of consciousness should be similarly analyzed. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 1. The fifty-two states that are associated with consciousness, that arise 
and perish together with consciousness, that have the same object and basis as 
consciousness, are known as <i>cetasikas</i> (mental states).</p>

<a name='9-1' href='?#9-1'><img src=lnk.png /></a><hr>

<h4>Notes:- </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. <b>Cetasika</b> = <i>Ceta + s + ika</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That which is associated with mind or consciousness is <i>cetasika</i>. 
(Sanskrit - <i>caitasika</i> or <i>caitti). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Definition-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Cetasika</i> is</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>(i) that which arises together with consciousness,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>(ii) that which perishes together with it,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>(iii) that which has an identical object with it,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p>(iv) that which has a common basis with it. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Readers will note that the author has not given here a logical definition 
according to genus and species. Instead he speaks of four characteristic 
properties of a <i>cetasika.</i> The Commentator cites reasons for attributing 
these four properties. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No consciousness exists apart from its concomitants. Both consciousness and 
its respective co-adjuncts arise and perish simultaneously. But there are some 
material qualities such as <i>viññatti rūpa*</i> (Modes of Intimation) - that 
arise and perish simultaneously with the consciousness. To exclude them the 
third property of having a common object has been attributed. That which 
possesses these three characteristics must necessarily be endowed with the 
fourth - a common basis. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>*[ <i>Kāyaviññatti</i> (mode of action) and <i>Vaci Viññatti</i> (mode of 
speech)]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Abhidhamma, mind or consciousness is accompanied by fifty-two 
mental states <i>(cetasikas). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of them is <i>vedanā</i> (feeling); another is <i>saññā</i>
(perception). The remaining fifty are collectively called <i>sankhārā.</i> <i>
Cetanā</i>
(volition) is the most important of them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole group of feelings is called <i>vedanā-kkhandha.</i> So are <i>
saññā-kkhandha</i>
and <i>sankhāra-kkhandha</i>. </p>

<h4>Notes:- </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. <b>Phassa</b>- Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>phas,</i>
to contact.</p>

<p>For any sense-impression to occur, three things are essential - namely, 
consciousness, respective sense and the object. For instance, one sees an object 
with the consciousness through the eye as its instrument. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When an object presents itself to the consciousness through one of the six 
senses there arises the mental state-contact. &quot;It should not be understood that 
mere collision is contact<i> (Na sangatimatto eva Phasso). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like a pillar which acts as a strong support to the rest of the structure, 
even so is contact to the coexistent mental concomitants. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Contact means &#39;it touches&#39; <i>(phusatī&#39;ti).</i> It has touching <i>(phusana)</i>
as its salient characteristic <i>(lakkhana), </i>impact <i>(sanghattana)</i> as 
its function <i>(rasa), </i>coinciding (of the physical basis, object and 
consciousness) as its manifestation <i>(sannipāta paccupatthāna),</i> and the 
object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause <i>
(padatthāna).&quot;</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contact is mentioned first because it precedes all other mental states. 
&quot;Touching by contact, consciousness experiences by feeling, perceives by 
perception, wills by volition - <i>(Phassena phusitvā, vedanāya vediyati, 
saññāya sañjānāti, cetanāya ceteti)&quot;.</i> According to <i>Paticca-Samuppāda,</i> 
too, Contact conditions Feeling. But strictly speaking, there is no reason for 
the sequence because all these mental states are coexistent. The Atthasālini 
states - &quot;For of states, arisen in one conscious moment, it is not valid to say 
that &#39;this&#39; arises first, &#39;that&#39; afterwards. The reason is not because contact 
is a strong support. Contact is just mentioned first in the order of teaching, 
but it was also permissible to bring it in thus: - There are feeling and 
contact, perception and contact, volition and contact; there are consciousness 
and contact, feeling, perception, volition, initial application of mind. In the 
order of teaching, however, contact is mentioned first. Nor is the sequence of 
words among the remaining states of any special significance.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Contact is given priority of place, as standing for the inception of the 
thought, and as the sine qua non of all the allied states, conditioning them 
much as the roof-tree of a storeyed house supports all the other combinations of 
material.&quot; </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Mrs. Rhys Davids - Buddhist Psychology, p. 6.) </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <b>Vedanā</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vid,</i>
to experience. </p>

<p>Feeling is a more appropriate rendering for <i>vedanā</i> than sensation. 
Like contact, feeling is an essential property of every consciousness. It may be 
pleasurable painful, or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. But 
physical feeling is not of ethical importance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the commentators feeling is like a master who enjoys a dish 
prepared by a cook. The latter is compared to the remaining mental states that 
constitute a thought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that experiences 
an object when it comes in contact with the senses. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this feeling that experiences the desirable or undesirable fruits of an 
action done in this or in a previous birth. Besides this mental state there is 
no soul or any other agent to experience the result of the action. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be understood here that Nibbānic bliss is not connected with 
feeling. Nibbānic bliss is certainly the highest happiness <i>(sukha),</i> but 
it is the happiness of relief from suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a 
pleasurable object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. <b>Saññā</b> - <i>Sam</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i>
to know, (Compare Latin cognoscere, to know.)</p>

<p>The meaning of this term widely varies according to the context. To avoid 
unnecessary confusion, it is best to understand the specific meaning used in the 
particular connection as a universal mental state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>saññā</i> is the cognition of an object by way 
of a mark as blue etc. It is <i>saññā</i> that enables one to recognize an 
object that has once been perceived by the mind through the senses. &quot;Its 
procedure is likened to the carpenter&#39;s recognition of certain kinds of wood by 
the mark he had made on each; to the treasurer&#39;s specifying certain articles of 
jewelry by the ticket on each; to the wild animal&#39;s discernment in the scarecrow 
of the work of man.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Saññā,</i> therefore, means simple sense perception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Perception,&quot; according to a modern Dictionary of Philosophy, &quot;is the 
apprehension of ordinary sense-objects, such as trees, houses, chairs, etc., on 
the occasion of sensory stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perception is not used here in the sense employed by early modern 
philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As one of the five <i>khandhas</i> (Aggregates) <i>saññā</i> is used in the 
sense of perception. </p>

<p>Could it be that memory is due to this <i>saññā? </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Saññā, viññāna</i> and <i>paññā</i> should be differentiated from one 
another. <i>Saññā</i> is like the mere perception of a rupee coin by a child. By 
its whiteness, roundness and size it merely recognizes the coin as a rupee, 
utterly ignorant of its monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its value 
and its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition. <i>Viññāna</i> is 
comparable to the ordinary man&#39;s knowledge of the rupee. <i>Paññā</i> is like 
the analytical knowledge of a chemist who knows all its chemical properties in 
every detail. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. <b>Cetanā</b> - </p>

<p>Both <i>cetanā</i> and <i>citta</i> are derived from the same root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>cit,</i> to think. </p>

<p>In the case of <i>citta</i> - mind or consciousness - the root assumes the 
meaning of discernment <i>(vijānana),</i> while in <i>cetanā</i> it is used in 
the sense of co-ordination <i>(abhisandhāna) </i>and accumulation <i>(āyūhana).</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Atthasālini and Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>cetanā</i> is that which 
co-ordinates the mental states associated with itself on the object of 
consciousness. <i>(Attanā sampayutta-dhamme ārammane abhisandahati). </i>Like a 
chief disciple, or like a carpenter who fulfills his duties and regulates the 
work of others as well, so does <i>cetanā</i> fulfill its own function and 
regulate the function of other concomitants associated with itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A further explanation has been offered. <i>Cetanā</i> is that which arrives 
at action in conditioning the conditioned. <i>(Sankhatābhisankharane va byāpāram 
āpajjatī&#39;ti cetanā).</i> <i>Cetanā</i> is that which plays a predominant part in 
all actions, moral and immoral.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shwe Zan Aung says that according to Ledi Sayadaw, the Burmese Abhidhamma 
scholar, &quot;Cetanā acts on its concomitants, acts in getting the object, and acts 
on accomplishing the task, i.e., determines action.&quot; (Compendium, p. 236).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most significant mental state in the Mundane Consciousness <i>(lokiya)</i>
is this <i>cetanā,</i> while in the Supra mundane it is <i>paññā,</i> wisdom or 
insight. Mundane thoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supra mundane thoughts, on 
the contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma. Hence <i>cetanā</i> in the supra mundane 
consciousness does not constitute Kamma. <i>Cetanā</i> in every moral and 
immoral type of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, is regarded as Kamma. 
Although <i>Cetanā</i> is found in <i>Vipāka</i> types of consciousness too, it 
is of no moral significance as it lacks accumulative power. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this <i>cetanā</i> that is alluded to as <i>sankhāra</i> and (Kamma) <i>
bhava</i> in the <i>Paticca Samuppāda.</i> In the <i>pañcakkhandha,</i> by <i>
sankhārakkhandha</i>
are meant the fifty mental states, excluding <i>vedanā</i> and <i>saññā,</i> 
with <i>cetanā</i>
as the foremost. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From a psychological standpoint <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of 
the mental states associated with it. From an ethical standpoint, it determines 
its inevitable consequences. Hence where there is no <i>cetanā,</i> there is no 
Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. <b>Ekaggatā</b> - </p>

<p><i>Eka + agga + tā</i> = one-pointedness, or concentration on one object, or 
focusing the mind on one object. It is like a steady lamp-flame in a windless 
place. It is like a firmly fixed pillar that cannot be shaken by the wind. It is 
like water that binds together several substances to form one concrete compound. 
This mental state prevents its adjuncts from dissipation and fixes them on one 
object. </p>

<p>This one-pointedness is one of the five Jhāna factors. When it is developed 
and cultivated it is designated <i>samādhi.</i> &quot;It is the germ of all 
attentive, selected, focused, or concentrated consciousness.&quot; (Compendium, p. 
241). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. <b>Jīvitindriya</b> - </p>

<p><i>Jīvita</i> = life; + <i>indriya</i> = controlling faculty or principle. </p>

<p>It is called <i>jīvita</i> because it sustains its co-associates. </p>

<p>It is called <i>indriya</i> because it controls its co-associates. </p>

<p>Although <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of all mental states, it is <i>
jīvitindriya</i> that infuses life into <i>cetanā</i> and other concomitants. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Jīvitindriya</i> is twofold - namely, psychic life <i>(nāma-jīvitindriya)</i>
and physical life <i>(rūpa-jīvitindriya).</i> Mental States are vitalized by 
psychic life, while material phenomena are vitalized by physical life. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As lotuses are sustained by water, an infant is sustained by a nurse, so are 
mental states and material phenomena sustained by <i>jīvitindriya. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> lasts for seventeen thought moments. Seventeen <i>
nāma-jīvitindriya</i> arise and perish during the brief life of one <i>
rūpa-jīvitindriya.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a certain kind of <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> in plant life. But, <i>
rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> in men and animals is differentiated from that which 
exists in plants because the former is conditioned by past Kamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i> and <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> arise at the 
moment of conception. They simultaneously perish at the moment of decease. Hence 
death is regarded as the perishing of this <i>jīvitindriya.</i> Immediately 
after, due to the power of Kamma, another <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i> arises in the 
subsequent birth at the moment of conception. Simultaneous with the arising of 
the one <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i>
there arise three <i>rūpa-jīvitindriyas</i> in the case of a human being.* </p>

<p>Just as a boatman depends on the boat and the boat depends on the boatman, 
even so <i>jīvitindriya</i> depends on mind and matter, and mind and matter 
depend on <i>jīvitindriya. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>*[They are the <i>Rūpa-Jīvtindriyas</i> of tho &#39;body decad&#39; <i>(kāyadasaka)</i>
&#39;sex-decad&#39; <i>(bhāvadasaka)</i> and &#39;seat-decad&#39;<i> (vatthudasaka).</i> See ch. 
VI.]</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8. <b>Manasikāra</b> - </p>

<p>The literal meaning of the term is &#39;making in the mind&#39;. </p>

<p>Turning the mind towards the object is the chief characteristic of <i>
manasikāra.</i>
It is like the rudder of a ship, which is indispensable to take her directly to 
her destination. Mind without <i>manasikāra</i> is like a rudderless ship. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Manasikāra</i> is also compared to a charioteer that sits with close 
attention on two well-trained horses (mind and object) as regards their 
rhythmical movements. <i>Manasikāra</i> should be distinguished from <i>vitakka</i> 
which is to follow. The former directs its concomitants to the object, while the 
latter applies or throws <i>(pakkhipanto viya) </i>them on the object. <i>
Vitakka</i> is like a favorite courtier that introduces a villager (mind) into 
the presence of a king (object). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Attention is the closest equivalent to <i>manasikāra,</i> although the Pāli 
term does not fully connote the meaning attached to the English word from a 
strictly philosophical standpoint. As a mental state it is mere spontaneous 
attention. In <i>manasikāra,</i>
as in attention, there is no peculiar vividness or clarity. To <i>saññā</i> may 
be attributed this vividness to some extent. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could <i>manasikāra</i> also be an aid to memory, as it is common to all 
types of consciousness, whether mundane or supra mundane? Hence they are 
designated <i>Sabbacitta-sādhāranā.
</p>

<p></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. <b>Vitakka</b> - </p>

<p><i>Vi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>takk,</i> to think. </p>

<p>It is difficult to suggest a suitable rendering for this Pāli term which 
assumes different meanings in the Suttas and Abhidhamma. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Sutta Pitaka it has been employed in the sense of notions, ideas, 
thoughts, reasoning etc. In the Abhidhamma it is used in a specific technical 
sense. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#39;Lifting&#39; of the concomitants to the object <i>(abhiniropana)</i> is its 
chief characteristic. As someone ascends to the king&#39;s palace depending on a 
king&#39;s favorite, relative or friend, likewise consciousness ascends to the 
object depending on <i>vitakka</i>
(Atthasālini, p. 114). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Vitakka</i> may well be defined as the application of the concomitants on 
the object. <i>Manasikāra,</i> as stated above, is the directing of the 
concomitants to the object. The distinguishing characteristics of these two <i>
cetasikas</i>
should be clearly understood. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different values are attached to <i>vitakka</i> when it is used in different 
connections. </p>

<p>As an ordinary particular <i>(pakinnakā)</i> mental state it is simply called <i>
vitakka.</i> When it is developed and cultivated it becomes the foremost factor 
of the First Jhāna. Then it is termed <i>appanā</i> because the mind is 
steadfastly fixed on the object. The ordinary <i>vitakka</i> simply throws the 
mind to the surface of the object. </p>

<p>In the subsequent Jhānas <i>vitakka</i> is, however, inhibited, owing to the 
habitual association with the object. </p>

<p>A villager, for instance, who visits the king&#39;s palace for the first time, 
needs the introduction of a favorite courtier. For his subsequent visits no such 
introduction is necessary as he is acquainted with the place. </p>

<p>It is this developed <i>appanā-vitakka</i> that is known as <i>samādhi</i>
or concentration. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When <i>vitakka</i> is present in the Supra mundane Path Consciousness <i>
(lokuttara magga citta) </i>it is termed <i>sammā sankappa</i> (Right Thoughts) 
because it eliminates wrong thoughts and applies the mind to Nibbāna. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Vitakka</i> is used in entirely a different sense when used in connection 
with the temperaments of individuals. <i>Vitakka carita</i> means one of a 
discursive temperament. (See Ch. 1. note 38.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. <b>Vicāra</b> - </p>

<p><i>Vi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>car,</i> to wander. </p>

<p>Like <i>vitakka, vicāra</i> too is employed in a technical sense in 
Abhidhamma. </p>

<p><i>Vicāra</i> is the continued exercise of the mind on the object. </p>

<p>Examination <i>(anumajjana)</i> is its chief characteristic. </p>

<p>So far the renderings for <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> are initial and 
sustained application respectively. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both terms should be distinguished. Like a bee alighting on a lotus is <i>
vitakka,</i>
like its gyrating around the lotus is <i>vicāra.</i> Like the flapping of a bird 
about to fly is <i>vitakka,</i> like its planning movements in the sky is <i>
vicāra.</i> Like the beating of a drum or bell is <i>vitakka,</i> like its 
reverberation is <i>vicāra. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Vicāra</i> is also a Jhāna factor. It inhibits <i>vicikicchā</i>
(Doubt or Indecision). (See Ch. 1. note 39.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. <b>Adhimokkha</b> - </p>

<p><i>Adhi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muc,</i> to release. Literally, 
the term means &#39;release-on-to&#39; . </p>

<p><i>Adhimokkha</i> releases the mind on to the object. Its chief 
characteristic is decision or choosing, and is opposed to <i>vicikicchā</i> - 
doubt or indecision. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It makes the decision - &#39;Just this one&#39;. <i>(imam&#39; evā&#39;ti 
sannitthānakaranam). </i></p>

<p>It is compared to a judge that decides a case. It is also compared to a 
steady pillar owing to its unwavering state. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. <b>Viriya</b> - </p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>aj,</i> to go + <i>īr.</i>
<i>Vī</i> is substituted for <i>aj. Vīra</i> is one who strenuously carries on 
his work uninterruptedly. </p>

<p>It is defined as the state or action of energetic persons <i>(Vīrānam bhāvo, 
kammam).</i> Or, it is that which is effected or carried out methodically <i>
(Vidhinā īrayitabbam pavattetabbam vā). </i></p>

<p>It has the characteristic of supporting <i>(upatthambana</i> upholding <i>
(paggahana),
</i>sustaining <i>(ussahana). </i></p>

<p>As an old house is supported by new pillars even so concomitants are aided 
and supported by Viriya.</p>

<p>Just as a strong reinforcement would help an army to hold on instead of 
retreating, even so<i> viriya</i> upholds or uplifts its concomitants. </p>

<p><i>Viriya</i> is regarded as a controlling factor <i>(indriya)</i>
because it overcomes idleness. It is also regarded as one of the five powers <i>
(bala)</i>
because it cannot be shaken by its opposite idleness. <i>Viriya</i> serves as 
one of the four means of accomplishing one&#39;s ends <i>(iddhi-pāda).</i> It is 
this <i>viriya</i> that appears as Four Modes of Supreme Efforts <i>
(samma-ppadhāna). Viriya</i> is sublimated as one of the seven factors of 
Enlightenment <i>(bojjhanga).</i> Finally it has been elevated to one of the 
eight members of the Noble Path <i>(atthangika-magga)</i> as <i>sammā vāyāma</i> 
(Right-Effort).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Atthasālini states that <i>viriya</i> should be regarded as the root of all 
achievements. </p>

<p>Effort, exertion, energy are suggested as best equivalents. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. <b>Pīti</b> - See Ch. 1. note 40. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>14. <b>Chanda</b> - </p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>chad,</i> to wish. </p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>chanda</i> is the wish-to-do <i>
(kattu-kamyatā).
</i>It is like the stretching of the hand to grasp an object. </p>

<p>This unmoral <i>chanda</i> should be distinguished from immoral <i>lobha</i>
which is clinging to an object. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three kinds of <i>chanda</i> namely, </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <p>(i) <i>kāma-cchanda</i> which is sensual craving, one of the Five 
		Hindrances <i>(nīvarana).</i> This is ethically immoral. </p>
        </li>
    <li>
        <p>(ii) <i>kattu-kamyatā</i> <i>chanda</i>, the mere wish-to-do. This is 
		ethically unmoral. </p>
        </li>
    <li>
        <p>(iii) <i>dhammacchanda,</i> righteous wish. It is this <i>
		dhammacchanda</i>
        that impelled Prince Siddhartha to renounce Royal pleasures. </p>
      </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Of them it is <i>kattu-kamyatā</i> <i>chanda</i>, meaning attached to this 
particular mental state, that serves as one of the four dominant influences <i>
(adhipati).
</i></p>

<p>Shwe Zan Aung says - &quot;The effort of conation or will is due to <i>viriya. 
Pīti</i> signifies an interest in the object; <i>chanda</i> constitutes the 
intention with respect to object.&#39; (Compendium p. 18). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buddhists have this <i>dhammacchanda</i> for the realization of Nibbāna. It 
is not a kind of craving. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>15. <b>Moha</b> - </p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>muh,</i> to be stupefied, to be 
deluded. <i>Moha</i> is one of the three roots of evil and is common to all 
immoral types of consciousness. It is opposed to <i>paññā</i> - wisdom. </p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>moha</i> is confusion with regard to the 
nature of an object. <i>Moha</i> clouds one&#39;s knowledge with regard to Kamma and 
its consequences and the four Noble Truths. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. <b>Ahirika</b> - </p>

<p>An abstract noun formed of <i>&quot;a&quot; + hirika. </i></p>

<p>He who is not ashamed of doing evil is <i>ahiriko. </i>The state of such a 
person is <i>ahirikkam = ahirikam. </i></p>

<p>One who has <i>hiri</i> recoils from evil just as a cock&#39;s feather shrinks in 
front of fire. One who has no <i>hiri,</i> would commit any evil without the 
least compunction. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>Anottappa</b> - </p>

<p><i>Na + ava +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>tapp,</i> to be tormented. </p>

<p><i>Ottappa</i> is fear to do evil, i.e., fear of the Consequences. </p>

<p><i>Anottappa</i> is its opposite and is compared to a moth that is singed by 
fire. A person who is afraid of fire would not touch it, but a moth, unaware of 
the consequences, attracted by fire, would get burnt. In the same way a person 
without <i>ottappa</i>
would commit evil and suffer in states of woe. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both these terms - <i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> - are found in conjunction. <i>
Hiri</i> should be differentiated from ordinary shyness and <i>ottappa</i>
from ordinary fear of any individual. Fear is regarded as one of the ten armies 
of Māra. A Buddhist is not expected to be afraid of any individual, even a God, 
for Buddhism is not based on the fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Hiri</i> arises from within, and <i>ottappa</i> from without. Suppose, for 
instance, there is a piece of iron, one end of which is heated, and the other 
smeared with filth. The filthy end one would not touch owing to disgust, and the 
other end through fear. Hiri is compared to the former and <i>ottappa</i> to the 
latter. </p>

<p>The following note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on <i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i>
clearly depicts the difference between these relative mental constituents:- </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa,</i> as analyzed by Buddhaghosa present points of 
considerable ethical interest. Taken together they give us the emotional and 
conative aspect of the modern notion of conscience, just as <i>sati</i> 
represents its intellectual side. The former term &#39;is equivalent to shame <i>
(lajjā),&#39; </i>the latter to &#39;anguish <i>(ubbego) </i>over evildoing.&#39; <i>Hiri</i> 
has its source within; <i>ottappa</i>
spring from without. <i>Hiri</i> is autonomous <i>(attādhipati); ottappa,</i>
heteronomous, influenced by society <i>(lokādhipati). </i>The former is 
established on shame; the latter on dread. The former is marked by consistency; 
the latter by discernment of the danger and fearsomeness of error. The 
subjective source of <i>hiri</i> is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to 
one&#39;s birth, age, worth, and education. Thus, one having <i>hiri</i>
will think &#39;Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poor wretches, the blind and 
ignorant, would do such an act,&#39; and refrains. The external source of <i>ottappa</i> 
is, the idea that &#39;the body of the faithful will blame you,&#39; and hence one 
refrains. If a man has <i>hiri,</i>
he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To one who is sensitive by way 
of <i>ottappa,</i>
the masters of the faith are the best guides.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a supplementary paragraph the &#39;marks&#39; (consistency etc.) are thus 
explained: &#39;In <i>hiri</i> one reflects on the worth of one&#39;s birth, one&#39;s 
teacher, one&#39;s estate, and one&#39;s fellow students. In <i>ottappa</i> one feels 
dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribution in 
another life.&quot; </p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, p. 20). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> are regarded as the two dominant factors that 
rule the world. No civilized society can exist without them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>18. <b>Uddhacca</b> -</p>

<p><i>U</i> = up, above, + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>Dhu,</i> to waver, to 
shake off. </p>

<p><i>Uddhutassa bhāvo Uddhuccam = Uddhaccam</i> - state of throwing up. It is 
compared to the disturbed state of a heap of ashes when hit with a stone. It is 
the unsettled state of mind, and is opposed to collectedness <i>(vupasama). </i>
As one of the five Hindrances it is the antithesis of <i>sukha,</i> happiness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some rare instances <i>uddhacca</i> is used in the sense of puffed-up 
state of mind, corresponding to conceit. Here it is not used in that sense. As a 
rule <i>uddhacca</i> is differentiated from <i>māna</i> because both of them are 
treated as <i>samyojanas</i> (Fetters). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These four, viz., <i>moha, ahirika, anottappa, uddhacca</i> - that head the 
list of Immoral <i>cetasikas</i> - are common to all Immoral types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>19. <b>Lobha</b> - See Ch. 1, note 9. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>20. <b>Ditthi.</b> - See Ch. 1, note 11. </p>

<p>The difference between <i>moha</i> and <i>ditthi</i> should be noted. The 
former clouds the object; the latter deals with one&#39;s views, such as &quot;this 
indeed is truth, and the rest is false&quot;. <i>Ditthi</i> is opposed to <i>ñāna,</i> 
wisdom. The former rejects the real nature and views wrongly. The latter 
discerns the object as it is. </p>

<p>When the Pāli term <i>ditthi</i> is used alone, unqualifyingly, it is 
employed in the sense of <i>micchā ditthi</i> - wrong belief. </p>

<p><i>Sammā ditthi</i> or <i>amoha</i> is used as the antithesis of <i>moha.
</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. <b>Māna</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>man,</i>
to think. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>22. <b>Dosa</b> - See Ch. 1, note 9. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>23. <b>Issā</b> - Derived from <i>i +</i> <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
<i>su,</i> to be envious, to be jealous. </p>

<p>It has the characteristic of envying others&#39; success and prosperity. As such 
it is objective. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>24. <b>Macchariya</b> - </p>

<p><i>Maccharassa bhāvo</i> - the state of an avaricious person. </p>

<p>Commentary gives another explanation:- </p>

<p>&#39;Let not this wonder be to others, but to myself&#39;. </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Mā idam acchariyam aññesam hotu, mayham&#39;ev hotu). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>macchariya</i> is the concealment of one&#39;s 
prosperity. Contrary to <i>issā, </i>this is subjective. </p>

<p>Both <i>issā</i> and <i>macchariya</i> are regarded as the friends of <i>dosa</i>
because each of them arises with it. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>25. <b>Kukkucca</b> - </p>

<p><i>Kukatassa bhāvo = kukkuccam</i> = the state of having done amiss. </p>

<p>According to the commentary evil that is done is <i>ku + kata,</i> and so is 
good that is not done. Remorse over the evil that is done is <i>kukkucca,</i> 
and so is remorse over the good that is not done. </p>

<p>It has the characteristic of grieving over the evil that is done and the good 
that is not done. </p>

<p>Dhammasangani explains:-</p>

<p>&quot;What is worry?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Consciousness of what is lawful in something that is unlawful, consciousness 
of what is unlawful in something that is lawful; consciousness of what is 
immoral in something that is moral; consciousness of what is moral in something 
that is immoral - all this sort of worry, fidgeting, over-scrupulousness, 
remorse of conscience, mental sacrificing - this is what is called worry&quot;.</p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology - p. 313). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Kukkucca</i> is one of the five Hindrances and is used together with
<i>uddhacca</i>. It pertains to past things only. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Vinaya, <i>kukkucca</i> is healthy doubt with regard to rules, 
and is commended. According to Abhidhamma, on the contrary, it is repentance 
which is not commended. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>26. <b>Thīna</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>the,</i>
to shrink, <i>+ na. Thena = thāna = thīna. </i></p>

<p>It is the shrinking state of the mind like a cock&#39;s feather before fire. It 
is opposed to <i>viriya. Thīna</i> is explained as <i>citta - gelaññam,</i>
sickness of the mind. </p>

<p>As such it is the antithesis of <i>citta-kammaññatā,</i>
adaptability of the mind, one of the <i>sobhana cetasikas. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. <b>Middha</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>middh,</i>
to be inactive, to be inert, to be incapable. </p>

<p>This is the morbid state of the mental factors. </p>

<p>Both <i>thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> are always used in conjunction, and are 
one of the five Hindrances. They are inhibited by <i>vitakka,</i> initial 
application, one of the Jhāna factors. <i>Middha,</i> too, is opposed to <i>
viriya.</i>
Where there are <i>thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> there is no <i>viriya. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Middha</i> is explained as the <i>kāya-gelañña,</i> sickness of the mental 
body. Here body is not used in the sense of material form, but is applied to the 
body of mental factors, viz., <i>vedanā, saññā and sankhāra</i> (feeling, 
perception, and the remaining fifty mental factors). Hence <i>middha</i> is the 
antithesis of <i>kāya-kammaññatā,</i> adaptability of mental factors. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both <i>thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> are explained in the Dhammasangani as 
follows:- </p>

<p>&quot;What is stolidity <i>(thīna)?&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;That which is indisposition, unwieldiness of intellect, adhering and 
cohering; clinging, cleaving to, stickiness; stolidity, that is, a stiffening, a 
rigidity of the intellect - this is called stolidity. </p>

<p>&quot;What is torpor <i>(middha)?&quot;</i></p>

<p>&quot;That which is indisposition, unwieldiness of sense, a shrouding, enveloping, 
barricading within; torpor that which is sleep, drowsiness; sleep, slumbering, 
somnolence this is called torpor&quot;. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>28. <b>Vicikicchā</b> - See Ch. 1, note 13. </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vicikicchā,</i> as a Hindrance, does not mean doubts with regard to the 
Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, etc., </p>

<p>Majjhima Nikāya commentary states - &quot;it is so called because it is incapable 
of deciding that it is as such.&quot; </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Idam&#39;ev&#39;idanti nicchetum asamatthabhāvato&#39;ti vicikicchā). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>29. <b>Saddhā</b> - <i>Sam,</i> well; + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>dah,</i>
to establish, to place, to put. </p>

<p>Sanskrit <i>sraddhā</i> is composed of <i>Srat</i> = faith + <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>dha</i> to establish. </p>

<p>According to Pāli, <i>saddhā</i> is well-established confidence in the 
Buddha, Dhamma, and the Sangha. Purification <i>(sampasādana)</i> of its mental 
associates is its chief characteristic. It is compared to the water-purifying 
gem of the universal monarch. This particular gem, when thrown into water, 
causes mud and water-weeds to subside. The water is consequently purified. In 
the same way <i>saddhā</i> purifies the mind of its stains. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This <i>saddhā</i> is not blind faith. It is confidence based on knowledge. </p>

<p>One might question whether a non-Buddhist could also possess this <i>saddhā.
</i></p>

<p>Atthasālini raises this very question and provides an answer which is rather 
unsatisfactory and inadequate. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Do men of false opinions not believe in their own teachers?&quot; questions 
Venerable Buddhaghosa. His answer is:-</p>

<p>&quot;They do. But that is not <i>saddhā,</i> it is a mere acquiescence in words <i>
(vacana-sampaticchana-mattameva)&quot;. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If <i>saddhā</i> is limited only to Buddhists, what shall we say when a 
non-Buddhist places his faith or confidence in his teacher? Surely his mind also 
gets purified to some extent when he thinks of his particular religious teacher.</p>

<p>Could it be <i>ditthi</i> - false view? Then it is immoral <i>(akusala).</i>
In such a case there is no occasion for a non-Buddhist to experience a moral 
consciousness. </p>

<p>Would it not be more correct to say that <i>saddhā</i> is mere confidence or 
faith, instead of restricting it to the Triple Gem? </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dhammasangani explains <i>saddhā</i> as follows:-</p>

<p>&quot;The faith which on that occasion is trusting in, the professing confidence 
in, the sense of assurance, faith, faith as a faculty and as a power&quot;. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, p. 14.)</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Saddhā</i> is also apprehension intuitively of experience or knowledge 
gathered in past births. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>30. <b>Sati</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>sar,</i>
to remember. </p>

<p><i>Sati</i> does not exactly correspond to the Western conception of memory. 
Mindfulness is a better equivalent for <i>sati.</i> It has to be developed. In 
the Satipatthāna Sutta are described in detail various methods to develop this <i>
sati.</i>
When it is highly developed one acquires the power of remembering past births. 
It is this <i>sati</i>
that is regarded as one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. </p>

<p><i>Sati</i> tends to present before oneself good things without allowing them 
to be forgotten. Its chief characteristic is &#39;not floating away&#39; <i>(apilāpana).</i>
Unlike pumpkins and pots that float on water, <i>sati</i> plunges into the 
object of thought. </p>

<p>It should be noted that this particular <i>sati</i> is not found in immoral 
types of consciousness. </p>

<p>What is found in immoral consciousness is <i>micchā sati</i> (wrong 
mindfulness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dhammasangani explains <i>sati</i> as follows:-</p>

<p>&quot;The mindfulness which on that occasion is recollecting, calling back to 
mind; the mindfulness which is remembering, bearing in mind, the opposite of 
superficiality and of obliviousness; mindfulness as faculty; mindfulness as 
power, right mindfulness&quot;. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Buddhist Psychology, p. 16). </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Commenting on <i>sati,</i> Mrs. Rhys Davids says:-</p>

<p>&quot;Buddhaghosa&#39;s comment on <i>sati,</i> in which he closely follows and 
enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38, shows that the traditional conception of 
that aspect of consciousness had much in common with the Western modern theory 
of conscience or moral sense. <i>Sati</i> appears under the metaphor of an 
inward mentor, discriminating between good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy 
went so far as to render it by &#39;conscience&#39;, but this slurs over the interesting 
divergence&#39;s between Eastern and Western thought. The former is quite unmystical 
of the subject of <i>sati.</i> It takes the psychological process or 
representative functioning (without bringing out the distinction between bare 
memory and judgment), and presents the same under an ethical aspect&quot;. </p>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>32. <b>Alobha</b> - </p>

<p>This is opposed to <i>lobha</i> (See Ch. 1 note 9). </p>

<p><i>Dāna</i> or generosity is implied thereby. This is a positive virtue 
involving active altruism. It is one of the three roots of good. Like a drop of 
water that runs off a lotus leaf without adhering to it, non-adhesion to an 
object is its chief characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>33. <b>Adosa</b> - </p>

<p>This is opposed to <i>dosa</i> (See Ch. 1 note 9). It is not mere absence of 
hatred or aversion, but is a positive virtue. </p>

<p><i>Adosa</i> is synonymous with <i>mettā,</i> Loving-kindness, which is one 
of the four sublime abodes <i>(brahma-vihāra)</i>. </p>

<p>Readers will note that in enumerating the sublime abodes only two are 
mentioned, viz. - <i>karunā</i> and <i>muditā.</i> The reason being that <i>
mettā</i>
is implied by this <i>adosa;</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> by <i>tatramajjhattatā,</i>
equanimity.</p>

<p><i>Adosa</i> is also one of the three roots of good. Like an agreeable 
friend, absence of churlishness or coarseness <i>(candikka)</i> is its chief 
characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>34. <b>Three Roots of Good:</b> -</p>

<p><i>Alobha, adosa and amoha</i> are the three roots of good. <i>Amoha</i>
is not mentioned amongst the nineteen Beautiful <i>cetasikas</i> because it is 
implied by <i>paññā</i>
- wisdom.</p>

<p>Atthasālini gives a vivid description of these three virtues as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;Of these three, <i>alobha</i> has the characteristic of non-adhesion of the 
mind to an object, or of not sticking like a drop of water on a lotus leaf. Its 
function is non-appropriation like an emancipated Bhikkhu (Arahat). Its 
manifestation is detachment like a man fallen in filth. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Adosa</i> has the characteristic of non-churlishness or non-resentment 
like an agreeable friend. Its function is the suppression of annoyance or 
feverishness like sandal wood. Its manifestation is loveliness like the full 
moon. The characteristic, function, etc., of <i>amoha</i> have been explained in 
connection with the term <i>paññindriya</i> (Faculty of Wisdom). Of these three, 
again, <i>alobha</i> is opposed to the taint of selfishness, <i>adosa</i> to 
that of impurity <i>(dussīlya), amoha</i> to the non-development of moral 
conditions. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Alobha </i>is the cause of generosity, <i>adosa</i> of morality, <i>amoha</i> 
of meditation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> what is in excess is not taken, for the greedy take 
what is in excess. Through <i>adosa</i> what is not less is taken, for the 
hateful take what is less. Through <i>amoha</i> what is unperverted is taken, 
for the deluded take what is perverted. Through <i>alobha,</i> one regards a 
manifest fault as such and admits it, but the greedy conceal it. Through <i>
adosa</i> one regards a manifest virtue as such and admits it, but the hateful 
efface it. Through <i>amoha,</i> one regards what really is as such and admits 
it, but the deluded regard what is false as true, and what is true as false. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is no sorrow arising from separation of the 
beloved, for affection is the intrinsic nature of the greedy as well as the 
inability to bear the separation from the beloved. Through <i>adosa</i> there 
arises no sorrow from association with the unbeloved since disagreeableness is 
the intrinsic nature of the hateful as well as the inability to bear the 
association with the unbeloved. Through <i>amoha</i> there arises no sorrow from 
not getting what one desires, for it is the intrinsic nature of the deluded to 
think - &#39;From where could it be got?&#39; etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there arises no sorrow from rebirth, since the former 
is opposed to craving and the latter is the root of craving. Through <i>adosa</i>
there arises no sorrow from decay, since the intensely hateful become quickly 
aged. Through <i>amoha</i> there is not sorrow from death, for a bewildered 
death is painful. There is no such death for the undeluded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;There is harmonious living to the lay people through <i>alobha,</i>
to the recluses through <i>amoha,</i> and to all through <i>adosa.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;In particular through <i>alobha</i> there is no rebirth in the plane of 
Petas, since beings are generally born amongst Petas through craving. <i>Alobha</i>
is the antithesis of craving. Through <i>adosa</i> there is no rebirth in the <i>
niraya</i>
(Woeful State). Through hate, which is of a churlish nature, beings are born in 
woeful states resembling hatred. <i>Adosa</i> is the antithesis of hatred. 
Through <i>amoha</i>
there is no rebirth in the animal plane. Due to utter delusion through 
ignorance, beings are born amongst animals. <i>Amoha</i> is the antithesis of 
ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Of them <i>alobha</i> dissuades attraction from lust; <i>adosa</i>
from recoiling through hate; <i>amoha</i> from stolid indifference through 
ignorance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover through these three there arise respectively these three notions - 
those of renunciation, non-anger and harmlessness; and those of loathsomeness, 
immeasurableness, and fundamental elements<i> (dhātu). </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> the extreme of indulgence in sensual pleasures is 
inhibited: through <i>adosa</i> that of self-mortification. Through <i>amoha</i>
there is training according to the Middle Path. </p>

<p>&quot;Similarly through <i>alobha</i> the bodily bond of covetousness <i>(abhijjhā 
kāyagantha)</i> is destroyed, through <i>adosa</i> that of ill-will, and through <i>
amoha</i>
the remaining two. </p>

<p>&quot;The first two states of mindfulness are accomplished by the power of the 
first two, and the last two by the power of the third. </p>

<p>&quot;Herein <i>alobha</i> is conducive to health, for the unattached person does 
not resort to what is attractive but suitable - hence health ensues. <i>Adosa</i>
is conducive to youthfulness, for the unhateful person remains young for a long 
time, being not burnt by the fire of anger which causes wrinkles and grey hair. <i>
Amoha</i> is conducive to longevity of life, for the undeluded person, 
distinguishing between what is agreeable and disagreeable, avoids the latter and 
adopts the former and lives long. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to the acquisition of wealth, for by generosity 
wealth is obtained. <i>Adosa</i> is conducive to the acquisition of friends, for 
by loving-kindness friends are won and are not lost. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Amoha</i> is conducive to personal achievements, for the undeluded 
person, doing only what is beneficial to himself, regulates his own self. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to divine life, <i>adosa</i> to Brahma life, and <i>
amoha</i> to Aryan life. </p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> one is at peace with his acquisition of wealth amongst 
beings and things belonging to one&#39;s party, for through their destruction there 
is no grief caused to him by excessive attachment. Through <i>adosa</i> amongst 
those belonging to other parties he is happy, for the non inimical person is 
devoid of the feeling of ill-will even amongst the hostile. Through <i>amoha</i> 
he is happy amongst those who belong to a neutral party, for the undeluded 
person is devoid of all attachment.
</p>

<p>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is insight into impermanence, for the greedy 
person does not see impermanence in things that are impermanent, owing to his 
desire for enjoyment. Through <i>adosa</i> there is insight into suffering for 
one with a loving-disposition has abandoned that grasping, the cause of 
vexation, and sees things as sorrowful. Through <i>amoha</i> there is insight 
into soullessness, for the undeluded person is skillful in understanding things 
as they truly are. He sees the guideless fivefold group as guideless. </p>

<p>&quot;As insight into impermanence and so on is brought about by these three 
states, so are these states brought about by insight into impermanence and so 
on. </p>

<p>&quot;Through insight into impermanence there is <i>alobha;</i> through insight 
into sorrow, <i>adosa;</i> through insight into soullessness, <i>amoha.</i> </p>

<p>&quot;Who indeed knowing well that this is impermanent would develop a desire for 
it? Who indeed perceiving ill in things would develop another ill caused by 
exceedingly violent anger? Who indeed realizing the emptiness of a soul would 
again fall into utter delusion? </p>

<p>(Atthasālini - pp. 137-139. See The Expositor Vol. i, pp. 167-170). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>35. <b>Tatramajjhattatā - </b></p>

<p>Lit., <i>tatra</i> = there, i.e., with respect to objects <i>majhattatā</i>
= middleness, that is, equipoise. </p>

<p>Impartial view of objects is its chief characteristic. It is compared to a 
charioteer who views equally a pair of well-trained horses. </p>

<p><i>Tatramajjhattatā</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> (equanimity) are sometimes used as 
synonymous terms. It is this <i>tatramajjhattatā</i> that is regarded as <i>
upekkhā</i>
of the four Sublime abodes. Hence <i>upekkhā</i> does not occur amongst the 
Sublime abodes. It is this <i>tatramajjhattatā</i> that is raised to the dignity 
of a <i>Bojjhanga,</i>
one of the seven factors of Enlightenment. <i>Tatra-majjhattatā</i> has also to 
be distinguished from hedonic <i>upekkhā</i> or indifference. At times both 
these mental states simultaneously arise in the same consciousness, e.g., in all <i>
upekkhā-sahagata kusala cittas.</i> </p>

<p>This <i>tatramajjhattatā</i> is regarded both as an intellectual and ethical <i>
upekkhā</i> (See Ch. 1. note, 42). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>36. <b>Kāya Passaddhi &amp; Citta-Passaddhi- </b></p>

<p><i>Passaddhi</i> is composed of<i> pa+<font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font>
sambh, </i>to calm, to be tranquil. </p>

<p><i>Passambh + ti = passadhti = passaddhi. </i></p>

<p><i>Passaddhi</i> is tranquillity, calmness, quietude, serenity. </p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>passaddhi</i> is the suppression or the 
allaying of feverishness of passions <i>(kilesadarathavūpasama). </i>It is like 
the cool shade of a tree to a person affected by the sun&#39;s heat. <i>Passaddhi</i> 
is opposed to <i>uddhacca,</i>
restlessness, or excitement. When highly developed it becomes a factor of 
Enlightenment <i>(bojjhanga).</i></p>

<p>This tranquillity is twofold, viz., tranquillity of <i>kāya</i> and <i>citta.</i>
Here <i>kāya</i> is not used in the sense of material body. It is the body of 
psychic factors - namely, <i>vedanā</i> (feeling), <i>saññā</i> (perception), 
and <i>sankhāra</i>
(mental states). It should be understood that <i>kāya</i> is used in the same 
sense in the subsequent <i>cetasikas</i>. <i>Citta</i> connotes the whole 
consciousness. The difference therefore lies between psychic factors and 
consciousness as a whole. The same explanation applies to the other pairs as 
well. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. <b>Kāya-Lahutā &amp; Citta-Lahutā - </b></p>

<p>Derived from <i>laghu,</i> light, quick. (Skt. <i>laghutā).</i> <i>Lahutā</i>
is bouyancy or lightness. Suppression of the heaviness of the mind and mental 
factors is its chief characteristic. It is like the laying down of a heavy 
burden. It is opposed to <i>thīna</i>
and <i>middha</i> - sloth and torpor - which cause heaviness and rigidity in 
mental factors and consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. <b>Kāya-Mudutā &amp; Citta-Mudutā - </b></p>

<p>The chief characteristic of <i>mudutā</i> is the suppression of stiffness and 
resistance. It removes stiffness and becomes pliable in receiving objects. It is 
compared to a skin that is well moulded by applying oil, water etc. It is 
opposed to false views and conceit <i>(ditthi and māna)</i> which cause 
stiffness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. <b>Kāya-Kammaññatā &amp; Citta-Kammaññatā - </b></p>

<p><i>Kamma + nya + tā = Kammanyatā = Kammaññyatā.</i> Lit., workableness or 
serviceableness. </p>

<p>Its chief characteristic is the suppression of unserviceableness or 
unworkableness of consciousness and its factors. It is like a heated metal made 
fit for any use. It is opposed to all the remaining Hindrances. Atthasālini 
states that these two allied concomitants produce serenity <i>(pasāda) </i>in 
propitious things, and are adaptable like pure gold, for beneficial works. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>40.<b> Kāya-Pāguññatā &amp; Citta-Pāguññatā - </b></p>

<p>This is proficiency or skillfulness. Its chief characteristic is the 
suppression of sickness of mind and its concomitants. It is opposed to such 
passions as faithlessness etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41. <b>Kāyujjukatā &amp; Cittujjukatā - </b></p>

<p>This is straightness or rectitude, and is opposed to crookedness, deception 
and craftiness. Its chief characteristic is straightness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42. All these 19 concomitants are common to all types of moral consciousness, 
unlike the immoral concomitants which do not arise in an immoral consciousness <i>
in toto.</i> No moral consciousness arises without all of them. Along with this 
&#39;Beautiful&#39; group some other moral concomitants may arise according to the type 
of consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>43.<b> Virati - </b></p>

<p><i>Vi</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> r<i>am,</i> to delight in. <i>Virati</i>
is refraining from, delighting in, i.e., abstinence. </p>

<p>According to the Atthasālini there are three kinds of <i>virati</i> - namely, <i>
sampatta-virati, samādāna-virati,</i> and <i>samuccheda-virati. </i></p>

<p><i>Sampatta-virati</i> is abstaining from evil as occasion arises considering 
one&#39;s birth, age, education, etc. </p>

<p><i>Samādāna-virati</i> is abstaining from evil in accordance with one&#39;s 
observances. For example, a Buddhist would abstain from killing, stealing, etc., 
as he observes the precepts not to kill, etc. </p>

<p><i>Samuccheda-virati</i> is the abstinence of an Aryan Disciple by completely 
eradicating all the roots of evil. </p>

<p>In the case of the former two, violation of good principles is possible; but 
in the case of Arahats it is not, because they have destroyed all passions. </p>

<p>Here are enumerated three Abstinences pertaining to wrong speech, wrong 
actions, and wrong livelihood. </p>

<p>Strictly speaking, these three mental concomitants collectively arise only in 
the Supra mundane consciousness<i> (lokuttara citta).</i> In other cases they 
arise separately because there are three <i>cetanās.</i> </p>

<p>These three when present in the <i>lokuttara citta</i> are regarded as 
Factors of the Path <i>(magganga),</i> and they constitute <i>sīla</i> 
(Morality). <i>Sammā-ditthi</i>
and <i>sammā sankappa</i> which constitute <i>paññā</i> (Wisdom) are implied by <i>
paññindriya</i>
and <i>vitakka-cetasikas</i> respectively. <i>Sammā vāyāma, sammā sati,</i> and <i>
sammā samādhi</i> which constitute <i>samādhi,</i> (Concentration) are implied 
by <i>viriya, sati,</i> and <i>ekaggatā</i> <i>cetasikas</i> respectively. </p>

<p><i>Sammā vācā</i> deals with abstinence from false speech <i>(musāvāda),</i>
slandering <i>(pisuna-vācā),</i> harsh speech<i> (pharusa-vācā)</i> and 
frivolous talk
<i>(sampapphalāpa). </i></p>

<p><i>Sammā kammanta </i>deals with abstinence from killing <i>(pānātipāta),</i>
stealing <i>(adinnādāna), </i>and sexual misconduct <i>(kāmesu micchācāra). </i></p>

<p><i>Sammā ājīva</i> deals with abstinence from selling poison, intoxicants, 
weapons, slaves and animals for slaughter. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>44. <b>Appamaññā - </b></p>

<p>As the object of these virtues is the infinite number of beings, they are 
called <i>appamaññā,</i> lit., illimitable (Skt. <i>aprāmānya).</i> They are 
also called <i>brahma vihāra</i> -Sublime Modes of Living. </p>

<p><i>Mettā, karunā, muditā, </i>and <i>upekkhā</i> are these four illimitables. </p>

<p>As explained above <i>mettā</i> and <i>upekkhā</i> are represented by
<i>adosa</i> and <i>tatra-majjhattatā.</i> Hence only two are mentioned here. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>45.<b> Mettā - </b></p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>mid,</i> to soften, to love. 
According to Sanskrit <i>mitrasya bhāvah = maitri;</i> state of a friend. That 
which softens the mind, or friendly disposition is <i>mettā.</i></p>

<p>Goodwill, benevolence, loving-kindness are suggested as the best renderings. <i>
Mettā</i> is not carnal love or affection. The direct enemy of <i>mettā</i>
is hatred or ill-will <i>(kodha),</i> its indirect enemy is affection <i>(pema). 
Mettā</i>
embraces all beings without exception. The culmination of <i>mettā</i> is the 
identification of oneself with all beings <i>(sabbattatā). </i></p>

<p><i>Mettā</i> is the sincere wish for the good and welfare of all. It discards 
ill-will. </p>

<p>Benevolent attitude is its chief characteristic. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>46.<b> Karunā - </b></p>

<p><font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>Kar,</i> to do, to make + <i>unā. </i></p>

<p>That which makes the hearts of the good quiver when others are afflicted with 
sorrow is <i>karunā.</i> That which dissipates the sufferings of others is
<i>karunā.</i></p>

<p>The wish for the removal of sufferings of others is its chief characteristic. 
Its direct enemy is wickedness <i>(himsā) </i>and its indirect enemy is grief <i>
(domanassa). Karunā</i> embraces sorrow-afflicted beings. It discards cruelty. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>47.<b> Muditā - </b></p>

<p>Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>mud,</i> to be pleased. </p>

<p>It is not mere sympathy but appreciative joy. Its direct enemy is jealousy 
and its indirect enemy is exultation <i>(pahāsa).</i> Its chief characteristic 
is happy acquiescence in others&#39; prosperity <i>(anumodanā). Muditā</i> embraces 
prosperous beings. It discards dislike <i>(arati),</i> and it is the 
congratulatory attitude of a person. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>48. Upekkhā - </b></p>

<p><i>Upa</i> = impartially, justly + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ikkh,</i>
to see, to view, to look. </p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> is to view impartially, i.e., neither with attachment nor with 
aversion. It is the balanced state of mind. Its direct enemy is passion <i>
(rāga),</i>
and its indirect enemy is unintelligent indifference. Attachment and aversion 
are eliminated by <i>upekkhā.</i> Impartial attitude is its chief 
characteristic. </p>

<p>Here <i>upekkhā</i> does not mean mere neutral feeling, but a sterling virtue 
is implied thereby. Equanimity is the closest equivalent. That term, too, 
conveys only one aspect of <i>upekkhā.</i> (See Ch. 1, notes 10, 42). It is this <i>
upekkhā</i>
that is elevated to a <i>bojjhanga</i> factor. </p>

<p><i>Upekkhā</i> embraces all good and bad ones, loved and unloved ones, 
agreeable and disagreeable things, pleasure and pain and all such similar 
opposite pairs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>49. </b>The following illuminating note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on these four 
virtues is well worth reading. </p>

<p>&quot;On these four great exercises, see Rhys Davids, S. B. E. xi 201, n.; and on 
their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa again refers to the reader to 
his Visuddhi Magga for a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix, and cf. Hardy, 
&#39;Eastern Monachism&#39;, p . 243 et seq. )... The object of thought <i>(ārammana)</i> 
in this connection will be &#39;limited&#39; if the student dwells in love etc., on but 
a restricted number of beings; &#39;infinite&#39; if his heart embraces vast numbers.</p>

<p>&#39;The commentator has not a little to say in the present work, however, on the 
nature and mutual relations of the &#39;Abodes&#39; (pp. 193-195). First, the 
characteristics of each are fully set forth, together with their false 
manifestation <i>(vipatti).
</i>Clinging <i>(sinehasambhavo)</i> is the <i>vipatti</i> of love, the 
essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent conduct etc. Tears and 
the like are less truly characteristic of pity <i>(karunā)</i> than is the 
bearing and relieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are less genuine 
expressions of sympathy <i>(muditā) </i>than is appreciation of what others have 
achieved. And there is a condition of disinterestedness <i>(upekkhā)</i> which 
is prompted by ignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of mankind 
which can avail to calm the passions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;He next designates the four antisocial attitudes which are to be extirpated 
by these ethical disciplines taken in order - ill-will <i>(vyāpāda),</i>
cruelty <i>(vihesā),</i> aversion <i>(arati), </i>and passion <i>(rāga) </i>- 
and shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms 
its near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical opposite, 
the latter resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. 
Love and vengeful conduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let love 
be developed fearlessly. But where love and its object have too much in common, 
love is threatened by lust. On this side let love be guarded well. Again the 
near enemy to pity, more insidious than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for 
what one has not got or has lost - a low, profane melancholy. And the 
corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, or in consequence of 
obliviousness as to what one has lost, lies in wait to stifle appreciation of 
the good fortune of others. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of 
the worldling who has not triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and 
effect, being unable to transcend external things.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The remainder of his remarks are occupied with the necessary sequence in the 
four Abodes, and the importance of observing method in their cultivation, and 
finally with their other technical appellation of <i>appamaññā</i> or 
infinitudes. In this connection he repeats the touching illustration given in 
Hardy (op. Cit., 249) of the mother, and the four children. Her desire for the 
growth of the infant is as <i>mettā;</i>
for the recovery of the sick child as <i>karunā;</i> for the maintenance of the 
gifts displayed by the youth as <i>muditā;</i> while her care not to hinder the 
career of her grown-up son is as <i>upekkhā.</i> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;It may be remarked, by the way, that when Hardy with a foreigner&#39;s want of <i>
muditā</i> calumniates the Buddhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about 
the virtues of solidarity without practicing them, he quite forgets that these 
exercises are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the 
intellectual need of others to which the recluse&#39;s life was largely devoted, and 
the importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of charity, 
does not even now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did not believe in 
giving the rein to good impulses unregulated by intellectual control&quot;. </p>

<p>50. Paññindriya -</b></p>

<p><i>Pa</i> = rightly; <i>ñā,</i> to know, <i>paññā,</i> literally, means right 
knowing. </p>

<p>Its chief characteristic is understanding as it really is, or irresistible 
understanding, i.e., penetrative knowledge <i>(Yathāsabhāva-pativedho vā 
akkhalita-pativedho). </i></p>

<p>As <i>paññā</i> dominates in understanding the real nature and as it 
overcomes ignorance, it is called a controlling faculty <i>(indriya). </i></p>

<p>In Abhidhamma <i>ñāna, paññā,</i> and <i>amoha</i> are used as 
interchangeable terms. In types of consciousness connected with knowledge <i>
(ñāna-sampayutta)</i>
the reference is to this <i>paññā.</i> By <i>amoha,</i> one of the three moral 
roots, is also meant this <i>paññā</i>. As one of the four means of 
accomplishing one&#39;s ends <i>(iddhi-pāda)</i>
it assumes the name of <i>vīmamsā</i> (lit., examination). When purified by <i>
samādhi,</i>
<i>paññā</i> assumes the honorable role of <i>abhiññā</i> (higher knowledge). 
Highly developed <i>paññā</i> is elevated to the state of a <i>
bojjhanga-dhamma-vicaya</i>
(Investigation of the Truth) and <i>magganga-sammā ditthi,</i> Right View. The 
culmination of <i>paññā</i> is the Omniscience of a Buddha. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Paññā,</i> in the strictest sense of the term, is seeing things as they 
truly are, i.e., in the light of <i>anicca</i> (impermanence), <i>dukkha</i>
(sorrow), and <i>anattā</i> (soullessness). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reason, intellect, insight, knowledge, wisdom, intelligence - all convey some 
aspects of <i>paññā,</i> but none of them exactly corresponds to the Pāli term. 
Both knowledge and wisdom are employed here according to the context. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rhys David&#39;s comment on this important term is interesting. She writes:- </p>

<p>&quot;To fit the term <i>paññā</i> with its approximate European equivalent is one 
of the cruxes of Buddhist philosophy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, 
insight, science, understanding and knowledge. All of these have been, and are, 
used in the literature of philosophy with varying shades of connotation, 
according as the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and 
precise or transcendental and - <i>passez-moi le mot</i> - having precise 
vagueness.</p>

<p>And each of them might, with one implication or another, represent <i>paññā</i>. 
The main difficulty in choice lay in determining whether, to the Buddhist, <i>
paññā </i>stood for mental function, or for the aggregate product of certain 
mental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to <i>paññā </i>in the 
Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation becomes possible. Here it 
must suffice to quote two. M i. 292, he who has <i>paññā (paññavā) </i>is 
declared in virtue thereof to understand <i>(pajānāti)</i>
the nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 
124 Gotama asks: what is this <i>paññā</i>? and himself sets out its content as 
consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the Jhānas, insight into 
the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one&#39;s self, the power of <i>
iddhi,</i> the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, into one&#39;s own past lives, 
the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa 
also (Visuddhi Magga Ch. XIV,) distinguishes <i>paññā</i>
from <i>saññā</i> and <i>viññāna.</i> He describes it as adequate to discern not 
only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain 
and non-substantiality) respectively, but also the path. For him, then, it might 
be called intellect &#39;at a higher power&#39;. And in Gotama&#39;s reply, all those terms 
are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
the term did not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree of 
complexity, but that it also implied mental process as cultivated in accordance 
with a certain system of concepts objectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. 
Hence I think it best to reject such terms as reason, intellect, and 
understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, or knowledge, or philosophy. 
Only they must be understood in this connection as implying the body of learning 
as assimilated and applied by the intellect of a given individual&quot;. </p>

<p>Immoral Mental States</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <ul>
    <li>

<p>Delusion, (Moral) </p>

    </li>
    <li>

<p>Shamelessness, (Moral) </p>

    </li>

<p>Fearlessness, and </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Restlessness - are common to every Immoral consciousness.</p>
      </li>
</ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
    <p>(b) Attachment is found only in the eight types of consciousness rooted 
	in attachment. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p>(c) Misbelief (*2) is found in the four types of consciousness 
	  accompanied by wrong view. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p>(d) Conceit (*3) is found in the four types of consciousness 
	  dissociated with wrong view. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
      <p>(e) Hatred, Jealousy, Avarice, and Worry (*4) are found in the two 
	  types of consciousness accompanied by ill-will.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
    <p>(f) Sloth and Torpor (*5) are found in the five types of prompted

    <p>(g) Doubt is found only in the type of consciousness accompanied by 
	doubt. </p>
        </li>
</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*1) The root of every evil is moha (ignorance), because the evil-doer is not 
aware of the evil consequences. With it are associated shamelessness to commit 
the evil and disregard for the effects that follow. There is a certain amount of 
restlessness of the mind when an evil is committed.]</p>

<p>(*2) As ditthi gives rise to the conception of &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine connected with 
oneself, it occurs in the consciousness rooted in attachment]</p>

<p>(*3) Māna too originates with the &quot;I&quot; - conception connected with oneself. As 
such it also is present only in types of consciousness rooted in attachment. 
Nevertheless, both ditthi and māna do not arise simultaneously in one particular 
consciousness. Where there is ditthi there is no māna. Commentaries compare them 
to two fearless lions that cannot live in one den. Māna may arise in those four 
types of consciousness dissociated with ditthi. But it does not follow that māna 
is ever present in them.]</p>

<p>(*4) These four cannot arise in a consciousness rooted in attachment because 
there is some form of aversion in them instead of any of clinging. Even 
macchariya is a kind of aversion to others&#39; viewing with oneself.]</p>

<p>(*5) Thīna and Middha are by nature opposed to adaptability. They lack the 
urge. As such they cannot arise in types of consciousness that are unprompted 
(asankharika) which are naturally keen and active. They appear only in types of 
prompted consciousness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Summary)</p>

    <p>§ 7. Four are found in all Immorals, three in those rooted in attachment, 
	four in those rooted in ill-will and so are two in the prompted. </p>
    <p>Doubt is found in the consciousness accompanied by doubt. Thus the 
	fourteen are conjoined only with the twelve Immorals in five ways. </p>

  <p>(b) Similarly in the Supramundane Second Jhāna consciousness, all the 
  above, excluding Initial Application.** </p>

<p>(c) In the Third, (all those) excluding Initial Application and Sustained 
Application. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) In the Fourth, (all those) excluding Initial Application, Sustained 
  Application, and Joy. </p>
  <p>(e) In the Fifth Jhāna type of consciousness which is accompanied by 
  Equanimity, all those excluding Initial Application, Sustained Application, 
  Joy, and Happiness. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus in every way fivefold is the synthesis of mental factors arising in the 
eight types of Supra mundane consciousness according to the five Jhānas. </p>

<p>Respectively there are thirty-six, thirty-five, thirty-four, and thirty-three 
in the last two. </p>

<p>Thus in five ways they arise in the Supra mundane. </p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

</font>

<p>* Because their objects are living beings, while the lokuttara consciousness 
has Nibbāna for its object.</p>

<p>** Vitakka is eliminated in the 2nd Jhāna. The elimination of other factors 
in the remaining Jhānas should be similarly understood.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52. Aniyatayogi and Niyatayogi -</b></p>

<p>Of the 52 types of mental states eleven are called <i>aniyatayogi</i> - 
unfixed adjuncts. They arise in different kinds of consciousness separately 
because their particular objects differ. They may or may not arise in those 
types of consciousness to which they are allied. For instance, <i>issā, 
macchariya,</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> must arise in a consciousness connected with 
aversion. One of the three must arise at one particular moment. All the three do 
not occur simultaneously. Besides they are not bound to be present in such a 
consciousness. So are the three Abstinences, two Illimitables, Conceit, Sloth 
and Torpor. </p>

<p>The remaining 41 types are called <i>niyatayogi</i> - fixed adjuncts. They 
invariably arise in those types of consciousness allied to them. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>53. Abstinences -</b></p>

<p>These three are collectively found only in the Supra mundane consciousness, 
as they constitute three of eight factors of the Noble Path. They cannot arise 
in the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara,</i> nor in the <i>kāmāvacara vipāka</i> 
and <i>kriyā cittas.</i> They deal with three forms of refraining from 
committing evil through word, deed, and livelihood. As such they arise 
separately only in the eight types of moral consciousness according to the 
abstinence from the particular evil. </p>

<p>These Abstinences appear in full force only in the <i>lokuttara-cittas,</i>
because the corresponding evils are completely eradicated by them. In the <i>
kāmāvacara-kusala-cittas</i>
there is only a temporary inhibition of evil.</p>

<p>As <i>kāmāvacara-vipāka-cittas</i> are merely effects they cannot arise in 
them. Since <i>kriyā-cittas</i> are experienced only by Arahats, they do not 
arise in them. In the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara</i> planes they do 
not occur because the need for moral purification, the function of these 
abstinences, does not arise there. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>54. Illimitables (Sublime Abodes)-</b></p>

<p>Of the four only two are mentioned here. The other two have already been 
dealt with in their respective places.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the objects of these tables are beings. Therefore 
they cannot arise in the Supra mundane consciousness which has for its object 
Nibbāna. This does not mean that Arahats and other Aryans do not possess these 
virtues. They are not present only in the Path and Fruit consciousness. </p>

<p>They do not occur in the fifth Jhāna as it is accompanied by <i>upekkhā</i>
- neutral feeling. In the <i>arūpa-cittas</i> also they do not arise as they 
also are connected with <i>upekkhā.</i> In the eight <i>kiriya cittas,</i> which 
the Arahats experience, they arise because the Arahats also radiate thoughts of <i>
karunā</i> and <i>muditā</i>
towards all beings. </p>

<p>Sense-Sphere Beautiful Consciousness</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>§ 14. (i) At first, in the first two (types of) Sense-Sphere Beautiful 
	  consciousness (*1) thirty-eight states go into combination - namely, 
	  thirteen miscellaneous and twenty-five Beautiful mental states. 
	  (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;25&nbsp;=&nbsp;38) </p>

<blockquote>
      <p>The two Illimitables and the three Abstinences should be fitted in 
	  severally. (*2)</p>
      <p>(ii) Similarly in the second couplet all of them arise excluding 
	  Wisdom; </p>
      <p>(iii) in the third couplet, associated with Wisdom, Joy is excluded; </p>
      <p>(iv) in the fourth couplet Wisdom and Joy (*3) are excluded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Functional consciousness the three Abstinences are excluded. (*4) 
Likewise in the four couplets they are combined in four ways. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly in the Resultant consciousness they all arise except the 
Illimitables and the Abstinences. (*5) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus in all the twenty-four types of Sense-sphere Beautiful types of 
consciousness the combination is twelve-fold according to pairs. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>§ 15. With respect to Sense-Sphere consciousness with roots -Moral, 
	Resultant, and Functional - there arise in the Moral (first pair) 
	thirty-eight, twice (*6) thirty-seven (in the second and third pairs), and 
	thirty-six( in the fourth pair). In the Functional thirty-five (in the first 
	pair), twice thirty-four (in the second and third pairs), thirty three (in 
	the forth pair). In the Resultant thirty three (in the first pair), twice 
	thirty-two (in the second and third pairs), thirty-one (in the fourth pair). </p>

<p>(*2) Because they are not fixed adjuncts. They arise at different moments of 
conscious experience.</p>

<p>(*3) Being accompanied by upekkhā.</p>

<p>(*4) Because the Arahats have completely eradicated the Abstinences.</p>

<p>(*5) Illimitables do not arise because they have limitless beings as the 
objects, while the Resultants are restricted to lesser objects. The Abstinences 
are absolutely moral. Hence they do not arise in a resultant consciousness. In 
the Supramundane Fruit consciousness they however arise because it is like a 
reflection of the Path consciousness.</p>

<p>(*6) i.e., thirty-seven in each of the second and third couplets.</p>

<p>(*7) i.e. in the rūpāvacara arūpāvacara planes. Because no occasion arises 
for such evil to spring up.</p>

Jhānas, differs with respect to Jhāna factors.</p>

<p>Immoral Consciousness</font></p>

<p></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 17.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) Now, in immoral consciousness, to begin with, in the first unprompted 
  consciousness (*1) nineteen mental states enter into combination - namely, 
  thirteen unmoral concomitants, the four common immoral concomitants, making 
  seventeen, together with attachment and misbelief. (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;19) </p>
  <p>(ii) Similarly in the second unprompted consciousness (*2) the same 
  seventeen, together with attachment and conceit. (13&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;19) </p>
  <p>(iii) Similarly in the third unprompted consciousness there are eighteen 
  concomitants, together with attachment and misbelief but excluding joy.(*3) 
  (12&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) </p>
  <p>(iv) Similarly in the fourth (there are eighteen) with attachment and 
  conceit. (12&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) </p>
  <p>(v) In the fifth unprompted consciousness connected with aversion the above 
  twenty concomitants, excluding joy, (*4) are combined together with hatred, 
  jealousy, avarice and worry. Of them jealousy, avarice and worry should be 
  combined separately.(*5) (12&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;20) </p>
  <p>(vi) In the five types (*6) of prompted consciousness the above 
  concomitants should similarly be combined with this difference that sloth and 
  torpor are included. (21; 21; 20; 20; 22). </p>
  <p>(vii) In the type of consciousness connected with restlessness fifteen 
  mental states occur - namely, eleven <i>aññasamānas</i> excluding conation 
  (*7) and joy, and the four immoral Universals. (11&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;15) </p>
  <p>(viii) In the type of consciousness connected with perplexity fifteen 
  states are similarly obtained together with perplexity, but devoid of 
  decision.(*8) (10&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;15) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus in all the twelve types of immoral consciousness synthesis becomes 
sevenfold when reckoned according to their different combinations.(*9) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 18. Nineteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty, twenty-two, fifteen, - 
thus they stand in seven ways in the immoral consciousness. </p>

<p>Those fourteen mental states - namely, the four immoral universals, and ten 
unmorals,(*10) are said to be associated with all the immoral types of 
consciousness. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*1) i.e., Somanassa sakagata ditthigata sampayutta asankhārika citta - 
Unprompted consciousness, accompanied by pleasure, connected with misbelief.</p>

<p>(*2) i.e., the unprompted consciousness not connected with misbelief. Conceit 
and misbelief do not coexist.</p>

<p>(*3) i.e.. the unprompted consciousness accompanied by upekkhā. Joy does not 
coexist with indifference.</p>

<p>(*4) Joy does not coexist with aversion and grief.</p>

<p>(*5) Being unfixed mental adjuncts (aniyatayogino). Their objects differ and 
they arise severally.</p>

<p>(*6) They are the four types of prompted consciousness rooted in attachment 
and the one rooted in aversion. Sloth and torpor are present only in the immoral 
prompted consciousness.</p>

<p>(*7) There is no chanda, the will-to-do, as restlessness is predominant here.</p>

<p>(*8) Adhimokkha, the mental factor that dominates in deciding cannot exist in 
a perplexed mind.</p>

<p>(*9) (i) 1st and 2nd asankhārika citta = 19; (ii) 3rd and 4th asankhārika 
citta = 18; (iii) 5th asankhārika citta = 20; (iv) 1st and 2nd sasanhhārika 
citta = 21; (v) 3rd and 4th sasankhārika citta = 20; (vi) 5th sasankhārika citta 
= 22; (vii) moha citta&nbsp;=&nbsp;15. Thus they divide themselves into seven classes 
according to numbering.</p>

<p>Rootless Consciousness</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 19. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(i) With respect to Rootless, in the consciousness of aesthetic pleasure 
  (*1), to begin with, twelve unmoral mental states, excluding conation, enter 
  into combination. (7&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;l2) </p>
  <p>(ii) Likewise they occur in the Determining (*2) consciousness, excluding 
  conation and joy. (7 +&nbsp;4 = 11 ) </p>
  <p>(iii) In the Investigating consciousness, (*3) accompanied by pleasure, all 
  but conation and effort. (7 + 4 = 11) </p>
  <p>(iv) In the Mano-dhātu triple (*4) and in the pair of rootless relinking 
  (*5) types of consciousness, all except conation, joy, and effort. (7 + 3 - 
  10) </p>
  <p>(v) (v ) In the two types of fivefold sense-consciousness (*6) all enter 
  into combination except the Particulars. (7 ) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus in all the eighteen types of rootless consciousness the mental states, 
numerically considered, constitute four groups. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>§ 20. Twelve , eleven , ten, seven - thus their grouping with respect to the 
eighteen rootless types of consciousness is fourfold. </p>

<p>In all the rootless the seven (Universals) occur. The rest (Particulars) 
arise accordingly. Thus in detail the groupings are told in thirty-three 
ways.(*7) </p>

<p>Understanding thus the combinations and synthesis of the mental adjuncts, let 
one explain their union with the consciousness accordingly.(*8) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*1) In the consciousness connected with laughter there is no wish-to-do, See 
Ch. 1, p.31.</p>

<p>(*2) It is the manodvāravajjana-mind-door consciousness-that assumes the name 
votthapana - Determining.</p>

<p>(*3) Although santīrana means investigating, it is a passive resultant 
consciousness. It lacks both will and effort.</p>

<p>(*4) Manodhātu - lit., the mere faculty of apprehension (mananamatta&#39; meva 
dhātu). It comprises the pancadvārāvajjana - sense-door consciousness, and the 
two sampaticchanas - recipient consciousness. The ten types of 
sense-consciousness are called dvipañca viññānadhātu. The remaining seventy-six 
types of consciousness are termed manoviññānadhātu, as they excel others in 
apprehension. </p>

<p>Both sampaticchanas are accompanied by upekkhā which does not coexist with 
pīti. Like the santīrana these two are resultants and are passive. Therefore 
they lack both effort and will. In the pancadvārāvajjana, too, as in 
manodvārāvajjana effort and will are lacking.</p>

<p>(*5) The two santīranas accompanied by upekkhā - both moral and immoral 
resultants are known as the ahetuka patisandhi yugala the pair of rootless 
relinking types of consciousness. Conception in woeful states is obtained by the 
akusala ahetuka santīrana, and amongst human beings as congenitally blind, deaf, 
etc., by the kusata ahetuka santīrana. This pair is also accompanied by upekkhā.</p>

<p>(*6) They are mere passive types of resultant consciousness.</p>

<p>(*7) Namely, i. 5 in anuttara; ii. 5 in mahaggata; iii. 12 in kāmāvacara; iv.
