<p><a name='9-1' href='?#9-1'>&nbsp;</a><font FACE="Arial"><u><b>CHAPTER II - Mental States (c<i>etasika)</i></b></u></font></p>
<font FACE="Arial"><b>

<p><a name='9-2' href='?#9-2'>&nbsp;</a>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p><a name='9-3' href='?#9-3'>&nbsp;</a>In the 89 types of consciousness, enumerated in the first chapter, 52 mental 
states arise in varying degree. </p>

<p><a name='9-4' href='?#9-4'>&nbsp;</a>There are 7 concomitants common to every consciousness. There are 6 others 
that may or may not arise in each and every consciousness. They are termed <i>
Pakinnakā</i>
(Particulars). </p>

<p><a name='9-5' href='?#9-5'>&nbsp;</a>All these 13 are designated <i>aññasamāna,</i> a rather peculiar technical 
term. <i>Añña</i> means &#39;other&#39;, <i>samana</i> means &#39;common&#39;. <i>Sobhanas,</i>
(Good), when compared with <i>asobhanas</i> (Evil,) are called <i>añña</i> - 
&#39;other&#39;, being of the opposite category. So are the <i>asobhanas</i> in 
contradistinction to <i>Sobhanas</i>.
</p>

<p><a name='9-6' href='?#9-6'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-7' href='?#9-7'>&nbsp;</a>These 13 become moral or immoral according to the type of consciousness in 
which they occur. </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a name='9-8' href='?#9-8'>&nbsp;</a>14 concomitants are variably found in every type of immoral 
	consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><a name='9-9' href='?#9-9'>&nbsp;</a>19 are common to all types of moral consciousness. </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><a name='9-10' href='?#9-10'>&nbsp;</a>6 other moral concomitants occur as occasion arises. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-11' href='?#9-11'>&nbsp;</a>Thus these fifty-two (7 + 6 + 14 + 19 + 6 = 52) are found in the respective 
types of consciousness in different proportions. </p>

<p><a name='9-12' href='?#9-12'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-13' href='?#9-13'>&nbsp;</a>In this chapter all the 52 mental states are enumerated and classified. Every 
type of consciousness is microscopically analyzed, and the accompanying mental 
states are given in detail. The type of consciousness in which each mental state 
occurs, is also described. </p>

<p><a name='9-14' href='?#9-14'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-15' href='?#9-15'>&nbsp;</a>To an impatient lay reader this chapter will appear rather dry and 
uninteresting. To a critical and intelligent reader it will, on the contrary, 
serve as an intellectual treat. </p>

<p><a name='9-16' href='?#9-16'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-17' href='?#9-17'>&nbsp;</a>At the outset, for instance, a student of chemistry may find the numerous 
chemical formulas somewhat perplexing. But he finds the subject interesting and 
edifying, when he seriously attempts to analyze and examine the various 
substances with different tests. </p>

<p><a name='9-18' href='?#9-18'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-19' href='?#9-19'>&nbsp;</a>In like manner a student of Abhidhamma who reads this chapter should first 
try to analyze and examine care fully every type of consciousness and see for 
himself the mental states thereof according to his own reasoning. Later, he 
should compare his results with the original text. He will then find this 
chapter most illuminating, and instead of wasting time in memorizing numbers, he 
will intelligently grasp the meaning of the text. </p>

<p><a name='9-20' href='?#9-20'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-21' href='?#9-21'>&nbsp;</a>For example, let us analyze the first immoral type of consciousness, rooted 
in attachment. </p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-22' href='?#9-22'>&nbsp;</a><i>Somanassa-sahagata -</i> Accompanied by pleasure,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-23' href='?#9-23'>&nbsp;</a><i>Ditthigata-sampayutta -</i> Connected with misbelief,</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-24' href='?#9-24'>&nbsp;</a><i>Asankhārika -</i> Unprompted. </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-25' href='?#9-25'>&nbsp;</a>This consciousness, when analyzed, will show that the <i>vedanā</i> or 
feeling is pleasure&#39;. </p>

<p><a name='9-26' href='?#9-26'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-27' href='?#9-27'>&nbsp;</a>The 7 Universals and all the Particulars are found in it.</p>

<p><a name='9-28' href='?#9-28'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-29' href='?#9-29'>&nbsp;</a>The 4 Immoral mental states common to all immorals such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-30' href='?#9-30'>&nbsp;</a> <i>moha</i>
(delusion), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-31' href='?#9-31'>&nbsp;</a> <i>ahirika</i> (shamelessness), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-32' href='?#9-32'>&nbsp;</a> <i>anottappa,</i> (fearlessness),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-33' href='?#9-33'>&nbsp;</a> <i>uddhacca</i> (restlessness) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-34' href='?#9-34'>&nbsp;</a>must arise in it. </p>

<p><a name='9-35' href='?#9-35'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-36' href='?#9-36'>&nbsp;</a>What about the remaining ten? </p>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Lobha</i> - attachment must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Ditthi</i> - misbelief must arise. </dt>
    </div>
    <div>
    <dt><i>Māna</i> - conceit cannot arise. </dt>
    </div>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p><a name='9-37' href='?#9-37'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-38' href='?#9-38'>&nbsp;</a>Conceit does not arise in <i>lobha</i> consciousness, together with 
misbelief. <i>Ditthi</i> is connected with wrong view, while <i>māna</i> is 
concerned with egoism. Both of them, say the commentators, are like two lions 
that cannot live together in one cave. </p>

<p><a name='9-39' href='?#9-39'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-40' href='?#9-40'>&nbsp;</a><i>Dosa</i> (hatred), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-41' href='?#9-41'>&nbsp;</a> <i>issā</i> (envy), </p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-42' href='?#9-42'>&nbsp;</a> <i>macchariya</i> (avarice),</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p><a name='9-43' href='?#9-43'>&nbsp;</a> <i>kukkucca</i> (brooding) </p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name='9-44' href='?#9-44'>&nbsp;</a>cannot arise, because these four are akin to aversion. They are found only in 
hateful consciousness.</p>

<p><a name='9-45' href='?#9-45'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-46' href='?#9-46'>&nbsp;</a><i>Thīna</i> and <i>middha</i> - (sloth and torpor) do not arise because this 
is an unprompted consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='9-47' href='?#9-47'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-48' href='?#9-48'>&nbsp;</a>No <i>sobhanas</i> - (beautiful) occur in an immoral consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='9-49' href='?#9-49'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-50' href='?#9-50'>&nbsp;</a>Total - 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19. </p>

<p><a name='9-51' href='?#9-51'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-52' href='?#9-52'>&nbsp;</a>Thus, on analysis, we see that the first immoral consciousness consists of 19 
mental states. </p>

<p><a name='9-53' href='?#9-53'>&nbsp;</a>The other types of consciousness should be similarly analyzed. </p>

these four properties. </p>

<p><a name='9-73' href='?#9-73'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-74' href='?#9-74'>&nbsp;</a>No consciousness exists apart from its concomitants. Both consciousness and 
its respective co-adjuncts arise and perish simultaneously. But there are some 
material qualities such as <i>viññatti rūpa*</i> (Modes of Intimation) - that 
arise and perish simultaneously with the consciousness. To exclude them the 
third property of having a common object has been attributed. That which 
possesses these three characteristics must necessarily be endowed with the 
fourth - a common basis. </p>

<p><a name='9-141' href='?#9-141'>&nbsp;</a>2. <b>Phassa</b>- Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>phas,</i>
to contact.</p>

<p><a name='9-142' href='?#9-142'>&nbsp;</a>For any sense-impression to occur, three things are essential - namely, 
consciousness, respective sense and the object. For instance, one sees an object 
with the consciousness through the eye as its instrument. </p>

<p><a name='9-143' href='?#9-143'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-144' href='?#9-144'>&nbsp;</a>When an object presents itself to the consciousness through one of the six 
senses there arises the mental state-contact. &quot;It should not be understood that 
mere collision is contact<i> (Na sangatimatto eva Phasso). </i></p>

<p><a name='9-145' href='?#9-145'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-146' href='?#9-146'>&nbsp;</a>Like a pillar which acts as a strong support to the rest of the structure, 
even so is contact to the coexistent mental concomitants. </p>

<p><a name='9-147' href='?#9-147'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-148' href='?#9-148'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Contact means &#39;it touches&#39; <i>(phusatī&#39;ti).</i> It has touching <i>(phusana)</i>
as its salient characteristic <i>(lakkhana), </i>impact <i>(sanghattana)</i> as 
its function <i>(rasa), </i>coinciding (of the physical basis, object and 
consciousness) as its manifestation <i>(sannipāta paccupatthāna),</i> and the 
object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause <i>
(padatthāna).&quot;</i> </p>

<p><a name='9-149' href='?#9-149'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-150' href='?#9-150'>&nbsp;</a>Contact is mentioned first because it precedes all other mental states. 
&quot;Touching by contact, consciousness experiences by feeling, perceives by 
perception, wills by volition - <i>(Phassena phusitvā, vedanāya vediyati, 
saññāya sañjānāti, cetanāya ceteti)&quot;.</i> According to <i>Paticca-Samuppāda,</i> 
too, Contact conditions Feeling. But strictly speaking, there is no reason for 
the sequence because all these mental states are coexistent. The Atthasālini 
states - &quot;For of states, arisen in one conscious moment, it is not valid to say 
that &#39;this&#39; arises first, &#39;that&#39; afterwards. The reason is not because contact 
is a strong support. Contact is just mentioned first in the order of teaching, 
but it was also permissible to bring it in thus: - There are feeling and 
contact, perception and contact, volition and contact; there are consciousness 
and contact, feeling, perception, volition, initial application of mind. In the 
order of teaching, however, contact is mentioned first. Nor is the sequence of 
words among the remaining states of any special significance.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-151' href='?#9-151'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-152' href='?#9-152'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Contact is given priority of place, as standing for the inception of the 
thought, and as the sine qua non of all the allied states, conditioning them 
much as the roof-tree of a storeyed house supports all the other combinations of 
material.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-157' href='?#9-157'>&nbsp;</a>3. <b>Vedanā</b> - Derived from <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>vid,</i>
to experience. </p>

<p><a name='9-158' href='?#9-158'>&nbsp;</a>Feeling is a more appropriate rendering for <i>vedanā</i> than sensation. 
Like contact, feeling is an essential property of every consciousness. It may be 
pleasurable painful, or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. But 
physical feeling is not of ethical importance. </p>

<p><a name='9-159' href='?#9-159'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-160' href='?#9-160'>&nbsp;</a>According to the commentators feeling is like a master who enjoys a dish 
prepared by a cook. The latter is compared to the remaining mental states that 
constitute a thought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that experiences 
an object when it comes in contact with the senses. </p>

<p><a name='9-161' href='?#9-161'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-162' href='?#9-162'>&nbsp;</a>It is this feeling that experiences the desirable or undesirable fruits of an 
action done in this or in a previous birth. Besides this mental state there is 
no soul or any other agent to experience the result of the action. </p>

<p><a name='9-163' href='?#9-163'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-164' href='?#9-164'>&nbsp;</a>It should be understood here that Nibbānic bliss is not connected with 
feeling. Nibbānic bliss is certainly the highest happiness <i>(sukha),</i> but 
it is the happiness of relief from suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a 
pleasurable object. </p>

<p><a name='9-167' href='?#9-167'>&nbsp;</a>4. <b>Saññā</b> - <i>Sam</i> + <font FACE="Symbol">Ö</font> <i>ñā,</i>
to know, (Compare Latin cognoscere, to know.)</p>

<p><a name='9-168' href='?#9-168'>&nbsp;</a>The meaning of this term widely varies according to the context. To avoid 
unnecessary confusion, it is best to understand the specific meaning used in the 
particular connection as a universal mental state. </p>

<p><a name='9-169' href='?#9-169'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-170' href='?#9-170'>&nbsp;</a>The chief characteristic of <i>saññā</i> is the cognition of an object by way 
of a mark as blue etc. It is <i>saññā</i> that enables one to recognize an 
object that has once been perceived by the mind through the senses. &quot;Its 
procedure is likened to the carpenter&#39;s recognition of certain kinds of wood by 
the mark he had made on each; to the treasurer&#39;s specifying certain articles of 
jewelry by the ticket on each; to the wild animal&#39;s discernment in the scarecrow 
of the work of man.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-171' href='?#9-171'>&nbsp;</a><i>Saññā,</i> therefore, means simple sense perception.</p>

<p><a name='9-172' href='?#9-172'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-173' href='?#9-173'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Perception,&quot; according to a modern Dictionary of Philosophy, &quot;is the 
apprehension of ordinary sense-objects, such as trees, houses, chairs, etc., on 
the occasion of sensory stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p><a name='9-174' href='?#9-174'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-175' href='?#9-175'>&nbsp;</a>Perception is not used here in the sense employed by early modern 
philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. </p>

<p><a name='9-176' href='?#9-176'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-177' href='?#9-177'>&nbsp;</a>As one of the five <i>khandhas</i> (Aggregates) <i>saññā</i> is used in the 
sense of perception. </p>

<p><a name='9-178' href='?#9-178'>&nbsp;</a>Could it be that memory is due to this <i>saññā? </i></p>

<p><a name='9-179' href='?#9-179'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-180' href='?#9-180'>&nbsp;</a><i>Saññā, viññāna</i> and <i>paññā</i> should be differentiated from one 
another. <i>Saññā</i> is like the mere perception of a rupee coin by a child. By 
its whiteness, roundness and size it merely recognizes the coin as a rupee, 
utterly ignorant of its monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its value 
and its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition. <i>Viññāna</i> is 
comparable to the ordinary man&#39;s knowledge of the rupee. <i>Paññā</i> is like 
the analytical knowledge of a chemist who knows all its chemical properties in 
every detail. </p>

<p><a name='9-181' href='?#9-181'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-182' href='?#9-182'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-183' href='?#9-183'>&nbsp;</a>5. <b>Cetanā</b> - </p>

<p><a name='9-184' href='?#9-184'>&nbsp;</a>Both <i>cetanā</i> and <i>citta</i> are derived from the same root <font FACE="Symbol">
Ö</font> <i>cit,</i> to think. </p>

<p><a name='9-185' href='?#9-185'>&nbsp;</a>In the case of <i>citta</i> - mind or consciousness - the root assumes the 
meaning of discernment <i>(vijānana),</i> while in <i>cetanā</i> it is used in 
the sense of co-ordination <i>(abhisandhāna) </i>and accumulation <i>(āyūhana).</i></p>

<p><a name='9-186' href='?#9-186'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-187' href='?#9-187'>&nbsp;</a>According to the Atthasālini and Vibhāvini Tīkā <i>cetanā</i> is that which 
co-ordinates the mental states associated with itself on the object of 
consciousness. <i>(Attanā sampayutta-dhamme ārammane abhisandahati). </i>Like a 
chief disciple, or like a carpenter who fulfills his duties and regulates the 
work of others as well, so does <i>cetanā</i> fulfill its own function and 
regulate the function of other concomitants associated with itself.</p>

<p><a name='9-188' href='?#9-188'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-189' href='?#9-189'>&nbsp;</a>A further explanation has been offered. <i>Cetanā</i> is that which arrives 
at action in conditioning the conditioned. <i>(Sankhatābhisankharane va byāpāram 
āpajjatī&#39;ti cetanā).</i> <i>Cetanā</i> is that which plays a predominant part in 
all actions, moral and immoral.</p>

<p><a name='9-190' href='?#9-190'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-191' href='?#9-191'>&nbsp;</a>Shwe Zan Aung says that according to Ledi Sayadaw, the Burmese Abhidhamma 
scholar, &quot;Cetanā acts on its concomitants, acts in getting the object, and acts 
on accomplishing the task, i.e., determines action.&quot; (Compendium, p. 236).</p>

<p><a name='9-192' href='?#9-192'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-193' href='?#9-193'>&nbsp;</a>The most significant mental state in the Mundane Consciousness <i>(lokiya)</i>
is this <i>cetanā,</i> while in the Supra mundane it is <i>paññā,</i> wisdom or 
insight. Mundane thoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supra mundane thoughts, on 
the contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma. Hence <i>cetanā</i> in the supra mundane 
consciousness does not constitute Kamma. <i>Cetanā</i> in every moral and 
immoral type of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, is regarded as Kamma. 
Although <i>Cetanā</i> is found in <i>Vipāka</i> types of consciousness too, it 
is of no moral significance as it lacks accumulative power. </p>

<p><a name='9-194' href='?#9-194'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-195' href='?#9-195'>&nbsp;</a>It is this <i>cetanā</i> that is alluded to as <i>sankhāra</i> and (Kamma) <i>
bhava</i> in the <i>Paticca Samuppāda.</i> In the <i>pañcakkhandha,</i> by <i>
sankhārakkhandha</i>
are meant the fifty mental states, excluding <i>vedanā</i> and <i>saññā,</i> 
with <i>cetanā</i>
as the foremost. </p>

<p><a name='9-196' href='?#9-196'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-197' href='?#9-197'>&nbsp;</a>From a psychological standpoint <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of 
the mental states associated with it. From an ethical standpoint, it determines 
its inevitable consequences. Hence where there is no <i>cetanā,</i> there is no 
Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='9-201' href='?#9-201'>&nbsp;</a><i>Eka + agga + tā</i> = one-pointedness, or concentration on one object, or 
focusing the mind on one object. It is like a steady lamp-flame in a windless 
place. It is like a firmly fixed pillar that cannot be shaken by the wind. It is 
like water that binds together several substances to form one concrete compound. 
This mental state prevents its adjuncts from dissipation and fixes them on one 
object. </p>

<p><a name='9-202' href='?#9-202'>&nbsp;</a>This one-pointedness is one of the five Jhāna factors. When it is developed 
and cultivated it is designated <i>samādhi.</i> &quot;It is the germ of all 
attentive, selected, focused, or concentrated consciousness.&quot; (Compendium, p. 
241). </p>

<p><a name='9-206' href='?#9-206'>&nbsp;</a><i>Jīvita</i> = life; + <i>indriya</i> = controlling faculty or principle. </p>

<p><a name='9-207' href='?#9-207'>&nbsp;</a>It is called <i>jīvita</i> because it sustains its co-associates. </p>

<p><a name='9-208' href='?#9-208'>&nbsp;</a>It is called <i>indriya</i> because it controls its co-associates. </p>

<p><a name='9-209' href='?#9-209'>&nbsp;</a>Although <i>cetanā</i> determines the activities of all mental states, it is <i>
jīvitindriya</i> that infuses life into <i>cetanā</i> and other concomitants. </p>

<p><a name='9-211' href='?#9-211'>&nbsp;</a><i>Jīvitindriya</i> is twofold - namely, psychic life <i>(nāma-jīvitindriya)</i>
and physical life <i>(rūpa-jīvitindriya).</i> Mental States are vitalized by 
psychic life, while material phenomena are vitalized by physical life. </p>

<p><a name='9-217' href='?#9-217'>&nbsp;</a>There is a certain kind of <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> in plant life. But, <i>
rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> in men and animals is differentiated from that which 
exists in plants because the former is conditioned by past Kamma. </p>

<p><a name='9-219' href='?#9-219'>&nbsp;</a>Both <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i> and <i>rūpa-jīvitindriya</i> arise at the 
moment of conception. They simultaneously perish at the moment of decease. Hence 
death is regarded as the perishing of this <i>jīvitindriya.</i> Immediately 
after, due to the power of Kamma, another <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i> arises in the 
subsequent birth at the moment of conception. Simultaneous with the arising of 
the one <i>nāma-jīvitindriya</i>

<p><a name='9-327' href='?#9-327'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-328' href='?#9-328'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;<i>Hiri</i> and <i>ottappa,</i> as analyzed by Buddhaghosa present points of 
considerable ethical interest. Taken together they give us the emotional and 
conative aspect of the modern notion of conscience, just as <i>sati</i> 
represents its intellectual side. The former term &#39;is equivalent to shame <i>
(lajjā),&#39; </i>the latter to &#39;anguish <i>(ubbego) </i>over evildoing.&#39; <i>Hiri</i> 
has its source within; <i>ottappa</i>
spring from without. <i>Hiri</i> is autonomous <i>(attādhipati); ottappa,</i>
heteronomous, influenced by society <i>(lokādhipati). </i>The former is 
established on shame; the latter on dread. The former is marked by consistency; 
the latter by discernment of the danger and fearsomeness of error. The 
subjective source of <i>hiri</i> is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to 
one&#39;s birth, age, worth, and education. Thus, one having <i>hiri</i>
will think &#39;Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poor wretches, the blind and 
ignorant, would do such an act,&#39; and refrains. The external source of <i>ottappa</i> 
is, the idea that &#39;the body of the faithful will blame you,&#39; and hence one 
refrains. If a man has <i>hiri,</i>
he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To one who is sensitive by way 
of <i>ottappa,</i>
the masters of the faith are the best guides.&quot;</p>

<p><a name='9-330' href='?#9-330'>&nbsp;</a>In a supplementary paragraph the &#39;marks&#39; (consistency etc.) are thus 
explained: &#39;In <i>hiri</i> one reflects on the worth of one&#39;s birth, one&#39;s 
teacher, one&#39;s estate, and one&#39;s fellow students. In <i>ottappa</i> one feels 
dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribution in 
another life.&quot; </p>

causes mud and water-weeds to subside. The water is consequently purified. In

<p><a name='9-416' href='?#9-416'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Do men of false opinions not believe in their own teachers?&quot; questions 
Venerable Buddhaghosa. His answer is:-</p>

<p><a name='9-417' href='?#9-417'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;They do. But that is not <i>saddhā,</i> it is a mere acquiescence in words <i>

<p><a name='9-420' href='?#9-420'>&nbsp;</a>Could it be <i>ditthi</i> - false view? Then it is immoral <i>(akusala).</i>
In such a case there is no occasion for a non-Buddhist to experience a moral

to remember. </p>

<p><a name='9-431' href='?#9-431'>&nbsp;</a><i>Sati</i> does not exactly correspond to the Western conception of memory. 
Mindfulness is a better equivalent for <i>sati.</i> It has to be developed. In 
the Satipatthāna Sutta are described in detail various methods to develop this <i>
sati.</i>
When it is highly developed one acquires the power of remembering past births. 
It is this <i>sati</i>
that is regarded as one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path. </p>

<p><a name='9-432' href='?#9-432'>&nbsp;</a><i>Sati</i> tends to present before oneself good things without allowing them 
to be forgotten. Its chief characteristic is &#39;not floating away&#39; <i>(apilāpana).</i>
Unlike pumpkins and pots that float on water, <i>sati</i> plunges into the 
object of thought. </p>

<p><a name='9-433' href='?#9-433'>&nbsp;</a>It should be noted that this particular <i>sati</i> is not found in immoral

<p><a name='9-442' href='?#9-442'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Buddhaghosa&#39;s comment on <i>sati,</i> in which he closely follows and 
enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38, shows that the traditional conception of 
that aspect of consciousness had much in common with the Western modern theory 
of conscience or moral sense. <i>Sati</i> appears under the metaphor of an 
inward mentor, discriminating between good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy 
went so far as to render it by &#39;conscience&#39;, but this slurs over the interesting 
divergence&#39;s between Eastern and Western thought. The former is quite unmystical 
of the subject of <i>sati.</i> It takes the psychological process or 
representative functioning (without bringing out the distinction between bare 
memory and judgment), and presents the same under an ethical aspect&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='9-459' href='?#9-459'>&nbsp;</a><i>Alobha, adosa and amoha</i> are the three roots of good. <i>Amoha</i>
is not mentioned amongst the nineteen Beautiful <i>cetasikas</i> because it is 
implied by <i>paññā</i>
- wisdom.</p>

<p><a name='9-460' href='?#9-460'>&nbsp;</a>Atthasālini gives a vivid description of these three virtues as follows:</p>

<p><a name='9-461' href='?#9-461'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Of these three, <i>alobha</i> has the characteristic of non-adhesion of the 
mind to an object, or of not sticking like a drop of water on a lotus leaf. Its 
function is non-appropriation like an emancipated Bhikkhu (Arahat). Its 
manifestation is detachment like a man fallen in filth. </p>

<p><a name='9-462' href='?#9-462'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Adosa</i> has the characteristic of non-churlishness or non-resentment 
like an agreeable friend. Its function is the suppression of annoyance or 
feverishness like sandal wood. Its manifestation is loveliness like the full 
moon. The characteristic, function, etc., of <i>amoha</i> have been explained in 
connection with the term <i>paññindriya</i> (Faculty of Wisdom). Of these three, 
again, <i>alobha</i> is opposed to the taint of selfishness, <i>adosa</i> to 
that of impurity <i>(dussīlya), amoha</i> to the non-development of moral 
conditions. </p>

<p><a name='9-463' href='?#9-463'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Alobha </i>is the cause of generosity, <i>adosa</i> of morality, <i>amoha</i> 
of meditation. </p>

<p><a name='9-464' href='?#9-464'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-465' href='?#9-465'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> what is in excess is not taken, for the greedy take 
what is in excess. Through <i>adosa</i> what is not less is taken, for the 
hateful take what is less. Through <i>amoha</i> what is unperverted is taken, 
for the deluded take what is perverted. Through <i>alobha,</i> one regards a 
manifest fault as such and admits it, but the greedy conceal it. Through <i>
adosa</i> one regards a manifest virtue as such and admits it, but the hateful 
efface it. Through <i>amoha,</i> one regards what really is as such and admits 
it, but the deluded regard what is false as true, and what is true as false. </p>

<p><a name='9-466' href='?#9-466'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-467' href='?#9-467'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is no sorrow arising from separation of the 
beloved, for affection is the intrinsic nature of the greedy as well as the 
inability to bear the separation from the beloved. Through <i>adosa</i> there 
arises no sorrow from association with the unbeloved since disagreeableness is 
the intrinsic nature of the hateful as well as the inability to bear the 
association with the unbeloved. Through <i>amoha</i> there arises no sorrow from 
not getting what one desires, for it is the intrinsic nature of the deluded to 
think - &#39;From where could it be got?&#39; etc. </p>

<p><a name='9-468' href='?#9-468'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-469' href='?#9-469'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there arises no sorrow from rebirth, since the former 
is opposed to craving and the latter is the root of craving. Through <i>adosa</i>
there arises no sorrow from decay, since the intensely hateful become quickly 
aged. Through <i>amoha</i> there is not sorrow from death, for a bewildered 
death is painful. There is no such death for the undeluded. </p>

<p><a name='9-470' href='?#9-470'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-471' href='?#9-471'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;There is harmonious living to the lay people through <i>alobha,</i>
to the recluses through <i>amoha,</i> and to all through <i>adosa.</i> </p>

<p><a name='9-472' href='?#9-472'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-473' href='?#9-473'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;In particular through <i>alobha</i> there is no rebirth in the plane of 
Petas, since beings are generally born amongst Petas through craving. <i>Alobha</i>
is the antithesis of craving. Through <i>adosa</i> there is no rebirth in the <i>
niraya</i>
(Woeful State). Through hate, which is of a churlish nature, beings are born in 
woeful states resembling hatred. <i>Adosa</i> is the antithesis of hatred. 
Through <i>amoha</i>
there is no rebirth in the animal plane. Due to utter delusion through 
ignorance, beings are born amongst animals. <i>Amoha</i> is the antithesis of 
ignorance. </p>

<p><a name='9-474' href='?#9-474'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-475' href='?#9-475'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Of them <i>alobha</i> dissuades attraction from lust; <i>adosa</i>
from recoiling through hate; <i>amoha</i> from stolid indifference through 
ignorance. </p>

<p><a name='9-476' href='?#9-476'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-477' href='?#9-477'>&nbsp;</a>Moreover through these three there arise respectively these three notions - 
those of renunciation, non-anger and harmlessness; and those of loathsomeness, 
immeasurableness, and fundamental elements<i> (dhātu). </i></p>

<p><a name='9-478' href='?#9-478'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-479' href='?#9-479'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> the extreme of indulgence in sensual pleasures is 
inhibited: through <i>adosa</i> that of self-mortification. Through <i>amoha</i>
there is training according to the Middle Path. </p>

<p><a name='9-480' href='?#9-480'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Similarly through <i>alobha</i> the bodily bond of covetousness <i>(abhijjhā 
kāyagantha)</i> is destroyed, through <i>adosa</i> that of ill-will, and through <i>
amoha</i>
the remaining two. </p>

<p><a name='9-481' href='?#9-481'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;The first two states of mindfulness are accomplished by the power of the 
first two, and the last two by the power of the third. </p>

<p><a name='9-482' href='?#9-482'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Herein <i>alobha</i> is conducive to health, for the unattached person does 
not resort to what is attractive but suitable - hence health ensues. <i>Adosa</i>
is conducive to youthfulness, for the unhateful person remains young for a long 
time, being not burnt by the fire of anger which causes wrinkles and grey hair. <i>
Amoha</i> is conducive to longevity of life, for the undeluded person, 
distinguishing between what is agreeable and disagreeable, avoids the latter and 
adopts the former and lives long. </p>

<p><a name='9-483' href='?#9-483'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to the acquisition of wealth, for by generosity 
wealth is obtained. <i>Adosa</i> is conducive to the acquisition of friends, for 
by loving-kindness friends are won and are not lost. </p>

<p><a name='9-484' href='?#9-484'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Amoha</i> is conducive to personal achievements, for the undeluded 
person, doing only what is beneficial to himself, regulates his own self. </p>

<p><a name='9-485' href='?#9-485'>&nbsp;</a><i>&quot;Alobha</i> is conducive to divine life, <i>adosa</i> to Brahma life, and <i>
amoha</i> to Aryan life. </p>

<p><a name='9-486' href='?#9-486'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> one is at peace with his acquisition of wealth amongst 
beings and things belonging to one&#39;s party, for through their destruction there 
is no grief caused to him by excessive attachment. Through <i>adosa</i> amongst 
those belonging to other parties he is happy, for the non inimical person is 
devoid of the feeling of ill-will even amongst the hostile. Through <i>amoha</i> 
he is happy amongst those who belong to a neutral party, for the undeluded 
person is devoid of all attachment.
</p>

<p><a name='9-487' href='?#9-487'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through <i>alobha</i> there is insight into impermanence, for the greedy 
person does not see impermanence in things that are impermanent, owing to his 
desire for enjoyment. Through <i>adosa</i> there is insight into suffering for 
one with a loving-disposition has abandoned that grasping, the cause of 
vexation, and sees things as sorrowful. Through <i>amoha</i> there is insight 
into soullessness, for the undeluded person is skillful in understanding things 
as they truly are. He sees the guideless fivefold group as guideless. </p>

<p><a name='9-488' href='?#9-488'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;As insight into impermanence and so on is brought about by these three 
states, so are these states brought about by insight into impermanence and so 
on. </p>

<p><a name='9-489' href='?#9-489'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Through insight into impermanence there is <i>alobha;</i> through insight 
into sorrow, <i>adosa;</i> through insight into soullessness, <i>amoha.</i> </p>

<p><a name='9-490' href='?#9-490'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;Who indeed knowing well that this is impermanent would develop a desire for 
it? Who indeed perceiving ill in things would develop another ill caused by 
exceedingly violent anger? Who indeed realizing the emptiness of a soul would 
again fall into utter delusion? </p>

psychic factors - namely, <i>vedanā</i> (feeling), <i>saññā</i> (perception), 
and <i>sankhāra</i>
(mental states). It should be understood that <i>kāya</i> is used in the same 
sense in the subsequent <i>cetasikas</i>. <i>Citta</i> connotes the whole 
consciousness. The difference therefore lies between psychic factors and 
consciousness as a whole. The same explanation applies to the other pairs as 
well. </p>

<p><a name='9-567' href='?#9-567'>&nbsp;</a><b>49. </b>The following illuminating note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on these four 
virtues is well worth reading. </p>

<p><a name='9-568' href='?#9-568'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;On these four great exercises, see Rhys Davids, S. B. E. xi 201, n.; and on 
their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa again refers to the reader to 
his Visuddhi Magga for a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix, and cf. Hardy, 
&#39;Eastern Monachism&#39;, p . 243 et seq. )... The object of thought <i>(ārammana)</i> 
in this connection will be &#39;limited&#39; if the student dwells in love etc., on but 
a restricted number of beings; &#39;infinite&#39; if his heart embraces vast numbers.</p>

<p><a name='9-569' href='?#9-569'>&nbsp;</a>&#39;The commentator has not a little to say in the present work, however, on the 
nature and mutual relations of the &#39;Abodes&#39; (pp. 193-195). First, the 
characteristics of each are fully set forth, together with their false 
manifestation <i>(vipatti).
</i>Clinging <i>(sinehasambhavo)</i> is the <i>vipatti</i> of love, the 
essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent conduct etc. Tears and 
the like are less truly characteristic of pity <i>(karunā)</i> than is the 
bearing and relieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are less genuine 
expressions of sympathy <i>(muditā) </i>than is appreciation of what others have 
achieved. And there is a condition of disinterestedness <i>(upekkhā)</i> which 
is prompted by ignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of mankind 
which can avail to calm the passions.</p>

<p><a name='9-570' href='?#9-570'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-571' href='?#9-571'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;He next designates the four antisocial attitudes which are to be extirpated 
by these ethical disciplines taken in order - ill-will <i>(vyāpāda),</i>
cruelty <i>(vihesā),</i> aversion <i>(arati), </i>and passion <i>(rāga) </i>- 
and shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms 
its near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical opposite, 
the latter resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. 
Love and vengeful conduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let love 
be developed fearlessly. But where love and its object have too much in common, 
love is threatened by lust. On this side let love be guarded well. Again the 
near enemy to pity, more insidious than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for 
what one has not got or has lost - a low, profane melancholy. And the 
corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, or in consequence of 
obliviousness as to what one has lost, lies in wait to stifle appreciation of 
the good fortune of others. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of 
the worldling who has not triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and 
effect, being unable to transcend external things.

<p><a name='9-573' href='?#9-573'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;The remainder of his remarks are occupied with the necessary sequence in the 
four Abodes, and the importance of observing method in their cultivation, and 
finally with their other technical appellation of <i>appamaññā</i> or 
infinitudes. In this connection he repeats the touching illustration given in 
Hardy (op. Cit., 249) of the mother, and the four children. Her desire for the 
growth of the infant is as <i>mettā;</i>
for the recovery of the sick child as <i>karunā;</i> for the maintenance of the 
gifts displayed by the youth as <i>muditā;</i> while her care not to hinder the 
career of her grown-up son is as <i>upekkhā.</i> </p>

<p><a name='9-575' href='?#9-575'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;It may be remarked, by the way, that when Hardy with a foreigner&#39;s want of <i>
muditā</i> calumniates the Buddhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about 
the virtues of solidarity without practicing them, he quite forgets that these 
exercises are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the 
intellectual need of others to which the recluse&#39;s life was largely devoted, and 
the importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of charity, 
does not even now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did not believe in 
giving the rein to good impulses unregulated by intellectual control&quot;. </p>

roots, is also meant this <i>paññā</i>. As one of the four means of 
accomplishing one&#39;s ends <i>(iddhi-pāda)</i>
it assumes the name of <i>vīmamsā</i> (lit., examination). When purified by <i>
samādhi,</i>
<i>paññā</i> assumes the honorable role of <i>abhiññā</i> (higher knowledge). 
Highly developed <i>paññā</i> is elevated to the state of a <i>

culmination of <i>paññā</i> is the Omniscience of a Buddha. </p>

<p><a name='9-586' href='?#9-586'>&nbsp;</a><i>Paññā,</i> in the strictest sense of the term, is seeing things as they 
truly are, i.e., in the light of <i>anicca</i> (impermanence), <i>dukkha</i>
(sorrow), and <i>anattā</i> (soullessness). </p>

<p><a name='9-587' href='?#9-587'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-588' href='?#9-588'>&nbsp;</a>Reason, intellect, insight, knowledge, wisdom, intelligence - all convey some 
aspects of <i>paññā,</i> but none of them exactly corresponds to the Pāli term. 
Both knowledge and wisdom are employed here according to the context. </p>

<p><a name='9-589' href='?#9-589'>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name='9-590' href='?#9-590'>&nbsp;</a>Mrs. Rhys David&#39;s comment on this important term is interesting. She writes:- </p>

<p><a name='9-591' href='?#9-591'>&nbsp;</a>&quot;To fit the term <i>paññā</i> with its approximate European equivalent is one 
of the cruxes of Buddhist philosophy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, 
insight, science, understanding and knowledge. All of these have been, and are, 
used in the literature of philosophy with varying shades of connotation, 
according as the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and 
precise or transcendental and - <i>passez-moi le mot</i> - having precise 
vagueness.</p>

<p><a name='9-592' href='?#9-592'>&nbsp;</a>And each of them might, with one implication or another, represent <i>paññā</i>. 
The main difficulty in choice lay in determining whether, to the Buddhist, <i>
paññā </i>stood for mental function, or for the aggregate product of certain 
mental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to <i>paññā </i>in the 
Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation becomes possible. Here it 
must suffice to quote two. M i. 292, he who has <i>paññā (paññavā) </i>is 
declared in virtue thereof to understand <i>(pajānāti)</i>
the nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 
124 Gotama asks: what is this <i>paññā</i>? and himself sets out its content as 
consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the Jhānas, insight into 
the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one&#39;s self, the power of <i>
iddhi,</i> the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, into one&#39;s own past lives, 
the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa 
also (Visuddhi Magga Ch. XIV,) distinguishes <i>paññā</i>
from <i>saññā</i> and <i>viññāna.</i> He describes it as adequate to discern not 
only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain 
and non-substantiality) respectively, but also the path. For him, then, it might 
be called intellect &#39;at a higher power&#39;. And in Gotama&#39;s reply, all those terms 
are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
the term did not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree of 
complexity, but that it also implied mental process as cultivated in accordance 
with a certain system of concepts objectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. 
Hence I think it best to reject such terms as reason, intellect, and 
understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, or knowledge, or philosophy. 
Only they must be understood in this connection as implying the body of learning 
as assimilated and applied by the intellect of a given individual&quot;. </p>

<p><a name='9-758' href='?#9-758'>&nbsp;</a>Of the 52 types of mental states eleven are called <i>aniyatayogi</i> - 
unfixed adjuncts. They arise in different kinds of consciousness separately 
because their particular objects differ. They may or may not arise in those 
types of consciousness to which they are allied. For instance, <i>issā, 
macchariya,</i> and <i>kukkucca</i> must arise in a consciousness connected with 
aversion. One of the three must arise at one particular moment. All the three do 
not occur simultaneously. Besides they are not bound to be present in such a 
consciousness. So are the three Abstinences, two Illimitables, Conceit, Sloth 
and Torpor. </p>

<p><a name='9-759' href='?#9-759'>&nbsp;</a>The remaining 41 types are called <i>niyatayogi</i> - fixed adjuncts. They

<p><a name='9-763' href='?#9-763'>&nbsp;</a>These three are collectively found only in the Supra mundane consciousness, 
as they constitute three of eight factors of the Noble Path. They cannot arise 
in the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara,</i> nor in the <i>kāmāvacara vipāka</i> 
and <i>kriyā cittas.</i> They deal with three forms of refraining from 
committing evil through word, deed, and livelihood. As such they arise 
separately only in the eight types of moral consciousness according to the 
abstinence from the particular evil. </p>

<p><a name='9-764' href='?#9-764'>&nbsp;</a>These Abstinences appear in full force only in the <i>lokuttara-cittas,</i>
because the corresponding evils are completely eradicated by them. In the <i>
kāmāvacara-kusala-cittas</i>
there is only a temporary inhibition of evil.</p>

<p><a name='9-765' href='?#9-765'>&nbsp;</a>As <i>kāmāvacara-vipāka-cittas</i> are merely effects they cannot arise in 
them. Since <i>kriyā-cittas</i> are experienced only by Arahats, they do not 
arise in them. In the <i>rūpāvacara</i> and <i>arūpāvacara</i> planes they do 
not occur because the need for moral purification, the function of these 
abstinences, does not arise there. </p>

<p><a name='9-772' href='?#9-772'>&nbsp;</a>They do not occur in the fifth Jhāna as it is accompanied by <i>upekkhā</i>

<p><a name='9-924' href='?#9-924'>&nbsp;</a>(*2) It is the manodvāravajjana-mind-door consciousness-that assumes the name 
votthapana - Determining.</p>

<p><a name='9-925' href='?#9-925'>&nbsp;</a>(*3) Although santīrana means investigating, it is a passive resultant 
consciousness. It lacks both will and effort.</p>

<p><a name='9-926' href='?#9-926'>&nbsp;</a>(*4) Manodhātu - lit., the mere faculty of apprehension (mananamatta&#39; meva 
dhātu). It comprises the pancadvārāvajjana - sense-door consciousness, and the 
two sampaticchanas - recipient consciousness. The ten types of 
sense-consciousness are called dvipañca viññānadhātu. The remaining seventy-six 
types of consciousness are termed manoviññānadhātu, as they excel others in 
apprehension. </p>

<p><a name='9-927' href='?#9-927'>&nbsp;</a>Both sampaticchanas are accompanied by upekkhā which does not coexist with 
pīti. Like the santīrana these two are resultants and are passive. Therefore 
they lack both effort and will. In the pancadvārāvajjana, too, as in 
manodvārāvajjana effort and will are lacking.</p>

<p><a name='9-928' href='?#9-928'>&nbsp;</a>(*5) The two santīranas accompanied by upekkhā - both moral and immoral 
resultants are known as the ahetuka patisandhi yugala the pair of rootless 
relinking types of consciousness. Conception in woeful states is obtained by the 
akusala ahetuka santīrana, and amongst human beings as congenitally blind, deaf, 
etc., by the kusata ahetuka santīrana. This pair is also accompanied by upekkhā.</p>

<p><a name='9-929' href='?#9-929'>&nbsp;</a>(*6) They are mere passive types of resultant consciousness.</p>

<p><a name='9-931' href='?#9-931'>&nbsp;</a>(*8) In this chapter are explained in what types of consciousness the 
respective mental states are present and what types of mental states occur in 
each type of consciousness. </p>

<p><a name='9-932' href='?#9-932'>&nbsp;</a>The author concludes the chapter advising the readers to explain the union of 
these mental states with each consciousness accordingly as, for example, - 
Universals are eighty-nine-fold because they are present in all the types of 
consciousness, phassa of the Particulars is fifty-fivefold because it arises in 
fifty-five types of consciousness, etc.</p>
